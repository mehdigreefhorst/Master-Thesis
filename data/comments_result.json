It is somewhat independent, but part of BSL is to mouth the word you are trying to say as some signs have multiple meanings; as well as this it uses the English alphabet, and requires you to know how to spell any English word you want to use but don't know the sign for. You could learn and communicate with BSL quite effectively if you have no understanding of English, but you wouldn't be able to speak it to its full effect; which is why it isn't COMPLETELY independent.",

It is somewhat independent, but part of BSL is to mouth the word you are trying to say as some signs have multiple meanings; as well as this it uses the English alphabet, and requires you to know how to spell any English word you want to use but don&amp;#39;t know the sign for. You could learn and communicate with BSL quite effectively if you have no understanding of English, but you wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to speak it to its full effect; which is why it isn&amp;#39;t COMPLETELY independent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
