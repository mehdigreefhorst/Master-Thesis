Try a couple of different masks until you find one that works for you. \n\nHelmets should be no problem either, I've had hearing aids for the last thirty year or so, and they have both gotten smaller and less prone to feedback. You will might have to turn the volume down a bit, but since you have managed without hearing aids until now i think you will do fine, even if the volume is turned down a bit. :)",
