    "text": "I've had hearing loss my entire life. I received one hearing aid for my left ear in elementary school, and fought my parents about wearing it until they gave up. Since then, I've been more or less supplementing with lip reading (I can't read lips, but I can tell what sounds people are making, if that makes sense) and also taking educated guests at conversations based on context. I've only had one hearing test in my adult life where they just handed me a pamphlet on hearing aids and said I needed them for both ears, I didn't like the clinic so I never went back. With every one wearing masks now, I am finding communicating very hard. I discovered one of the hearing clinics near me is run by my childhood audiologist who I really liked, so I made an appointment for a hearing test later this week. I have a couple questions:\n\n1) I've never told my GP about my hearing loss, but I put her down as someone who should get the results of my hearing test. I'm anxious she's going to get upset I booked a hearing test without talking to her first. And also that maybe it's not normal for your GP to receive your hearing test results? Do you send your results to your GP? She's the only doctor I have currently, other than an eye doctor. I've only been seeing her for a couple years, and almost all of my appointments with her are around one thing. Also, this may seem silly, but how do I tell her I've just been in denial and ignoring my hearing loss for the past 20 years?\n\n2) MASKS. I wear glasses, and obviously these days there are a lot of masks being worn. I know there are ones that tie around your head instead of your ears that can be worn where non-medical masks are required. But, around here, medical grade masks must be worn in health care places. Which I frequent, and often receive at the place. Tie around masks aren't an option here, how do you all wear so many things behind your ears. (I'm not sure what kind of hearing aids I will get, so this may not end up being a relevant question)\n\n3) Sports. I play roller derby when it's not so pandemic-y out. Do any of you play sports, especially contact sports with hearing aids? Do you have to do anything special to them to make them suitable? Does having a helmet against them make them have a lot of feed back?\n\nThanks for reading this far if you have. Sorry for all of my anxious questions.",

Try a couple of different masks until you find one that works for you. \n\nHelmets should be no problem either, I've had hearing aids for the last thirty year or so, and they have both gotten smaller and less prone to feedback. You will might have to turn the volume down a bit, but since you have managed without hearing aids until now i think you will do fine, even if the volume is turned down a bit. :)",
