I do have Deaf visitors from aboard coming to the UK and then learning a little bit of BSL without ever learning English. \n\n2. Yes it can be used effectively. The only problem is that there are some words that do not have a sign and needs to fingerspelt, so those without English either spell the word in their native language or describe whatever is it they want to say.\n\n3. BSL does not have a sign for those two words, they'd have to fingerspell it.",

It is somewhat independent, but part of BSL is to mouth the word you are trying to say as some signs have multiple meanings; as well as this it uses the English alphabet, and requires you to know how to spell any English word you want to use but don't know the sign for. You could learn and communicate with BSL quite effectively if you have no understanding of English, but you wouldn't be able to speak it to its full effect; which is why it isn't COMPLETELY independent.",
