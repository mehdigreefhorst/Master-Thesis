The hard part of a CI is filtering through all the NOISE that you suddenly have to figure out,  to identify voices , when you've never heard a voice,  or heard it last 25 years ago.   But you - only just lost your hearing ,  you will recognize all the noise and put them into their labeled boxes and be talking on the phone the first month!  ( took me over a year to be able to hear well,  after my CI was turned on.  But isnt it nice to every day be hearing better,  rather than worse!)",

My family spent a lot of money, I was really depressed and made big sacrifices to ‚Äúcompensate‚Äù at school and med school, which payed off but led to anxiety. Years have gone by and I got a better hearing aid in one ear and might get a cochlear implant in the other one someday. All I can tell you is that humans can adapt; this is not the end of your life.
