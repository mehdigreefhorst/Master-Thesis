Also some clips in BSL Zone is related to deaf community or culture so most of deaf people would understand this joke but hearing people won't so learn few deaf cultures. The best way to learn deaf cultures is meet deaf people. Go to deaf events like pub nights or deaf club. Deaf people are normally welcoming people",
