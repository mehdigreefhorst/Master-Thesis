I am learning ASL, but unfortunately, I am still very much a beginner. \n\nI was hoping someone here would be able to confirm for me what type of Sign language is being used by the signing character in John Wick 2. I have found very little writing on the language used, but I have seen it referred to as International Sign Language, SSE and ASL. \n\nAny help you can provide is greatly appreciated! \n\nThanks!",

                    "text": "Agreed. I’ve only been studying the language for a year now, but even I could see that this is just bad ASL, like the actress was slurring her words almost. \n\nTo answer your question OP, I would say that this is definitely not grammatically correct ASL; in my opinion (mind you I’ve only been studying for a year), it seems to teeter on the spectrum between Pidgin Signed English (PSE) and ASL. For instance, in the final scene, the (presumably deaf) character signs to John: SEE-YOU,  to which John signs, SURE. In my opinion, this definitely seems to be more ASL than SEE, especially since the subtitles read: “Be seeing you,” yet the character does not sign each of those words; if this was SEE, the character would’ve signed: BE SEEING YOU. Despite appearing more similar to ASL than SEE, the signing is nowhere close to the level of a Native user of ASL; therefore, I would consider it to be more PSE in nature. \n\nThe reason I say the signing (at least in last scene is) more PSE than ASL is because the exchange lacks the grammar of ASL (Facial expressions, Non Manual Markers, etc.). Also, considering that these characters speak their words as they sign, I feel that it is also more PSE (although it also possible a Deaf individual may speak their words while they sign ASL, they typically do not do so, and if they do—it is usually done so as way to better accommodate their hearing audience). I feel as though this is more PSE than ASL simply due to the fact that there were some unfamiliar signs being used. For instance, when she asks John if he had a “tough night.” Her sign for TOUGH was unfamiliar to me; this was also the case when she signed “I’ll finish this”; that gesture she uses (where she points down), doesn’t seem to translate well for me; it’s definitely not a variation of FINISH, nor is it similar to idioms I’m aware of. Also, while I was watching this character sign to John, I did understand what she was saying, but I was still confused—her sign production is far from strong and can be—at best—considered the variant of “slurring” ones words in a spoken language. All in all, a big let-down to the Deaf community. \n\nAlso, I think it’s important to mention a couple of things: \n\n1). I think it’s important to consider the subtitling of the movie; it’s not very good—which could be also be why the signing doesn’t appear to fit perfectly into any specific category. For instance, when the signing character signs SEE-YOU, I would’ve interpreted that to mean: “see you around,” but ASL is a very context based language, and is depend on Facial Grammar, and the character really doesn’t do much to reflect the tonality of the signs, so perhaps I would instead interpret it to mean: “See you,” which is why this doesn’t appear to be ASL to me. \n\n2). Keep in mind that ASL, PSE, and SEE coexist on a spectrum, and is not always going to be completely distinguishable based on singing or mouthing; to really spot the difference, one would need to interact within the Deaf community, see how they meaningfully sign nouns and verbs, use their entire face to sign adjectives, and use inflection to portray adverbs. If you really wanted to pin down what she was signing, maybe perhaps look into the movie character’s actual background; is she Deaf, HoH, et.\n\n\nFor the record, I am born and raised hearing; however, after embarking on my ASL journey, I am quickly placing roots in the Deaf community; I’m just ready for this virus to end so I can talk to my friends in person—instead of through a video camera!\n\nAnyways, I know that this is a long post, but I thought I would try to give you as much information as I possibly could off the top of my head. \n\nGood luck!",
