I am about to start working on the captions.\n\nAny advice on how to make the CC as easy to read as possible? I want to make sure I'm writing them well so they are easily accessible to everyone. Is there anything that annoys you when Editors write captions?",

The US government has [a page with some basics](https://www.section508.gov/create/captions-transcripts/).\n\nA few things that specifically annoy me:\n\n* Captions that censor things that are not censored verbally. (If the dialog says \"fuck you\", the CC should say \"fuck you\", not \"f--- you\". \n* CC that covers subtitles. If you have a subject speaking a different language or who's hard enough to hear that you have to caption it for hearing audiences, make sure that the CC don't cover that. (\"Speaks foreign language\" is the most annoying thing.)\n* Captions that don't match what's said. This can either be because they were \"written\" by AI and not reviewed, or because someone was writing the general gist of what it said instead of the exact words.",
