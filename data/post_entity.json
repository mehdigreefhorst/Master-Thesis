            "text": "Tip for the future: imagine you’re writing an essay and you need to change up your wording because otherwise you’d be repeating the same term over and over. Think about how else you’d communicate the idea. So instead of “televise,” what other terms capture that concept? Or, think about how you’d explain the concept to someone unfamiliar with televise. \n\nThat mindset should help when you look up signs you don’t know and also recall when signing. A lot of English words don’t have 1:1 English to sign translation, so you need to get creative and really think about what you’re *communicating*, rather than simply *saying.*",

What's the difference in the word \"run\": \"my car is running alright\" and \"I ran to the store today\"? If you use an ASL dictionary to look for the word run, you'll find the sign RUN, which means to physically run. But that's not what \"run\" means in either context. Same with \"televise\", what does it mean? Ignore the English as best as you can, and look at the meaning. \n\nHope that made sense :) good luck in your studies!",
