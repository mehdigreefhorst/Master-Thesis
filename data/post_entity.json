    "text": "I see so many lost in hearing loss and I was there myself in 2008 for a few years. Hearing loss isn't the end of the world though I know it feels like it at times. (My entire life changed after the last big drop.) After attending many events provided by the state of Utah, I learned that hearing loss is a different way of communicating and I now know the work arounds. If people don't do their part, I can't do my part. (Get my attention first and face me.) I learned how to self advocate which made a huge difference and I know all my options for accommodations. None of this information seems to be shared freely from doctors and so on. It's still a huge mystery and the best kept secret. \n\nWe are trying to change that. We offer the only how-to video podcast out there for hearing loss specific situations and they are free. Julia, Michele and Chelle share their perspectives providing options for any given situation.  Julia is a hearing CART/live captioning provider who has family members with hearing loss. Michele is deaf, relies on lipreading (she's our master lipreader) and captioning for communication. Chelle has a severe hearing loss using hearing aids and other technology along with lipreading.\n\nIn 2022 we will have more guests from the HoH community to share inspiration. Our podcasts are available on video with captions, in a transcript on BuzzSprout and audibly on different platforms.  We have 18 podcasts completed and viewable on our website or on YouTube. We will continue to bring one a week in 2022.
