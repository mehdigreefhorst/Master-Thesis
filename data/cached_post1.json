I did CT scan and was diagnosed with otosclerosis (no family history) in both ears, but one was worse than the other. I was fitted with hearing aids.\n\nOver time, my left ear, which had always been the stronger one, also started to decline. Two years ago, I was told the loss had become sensorineural, not conductive anymore, based on my audiometry results. I was told that the hearing loss in both ears would be slow and progressive. \n\nTwo days ago, I woke up and couldn’t hear out of my left ear (the comparatively good ear). What little I can hear sounds robotic and muffled. I rushed to the ER and asked for a steroid shot, just to be safe, but nothing was done. I went to another hospital and it was the same experience.\n\nEventually, I found an ENT who actually took me seriously. He gave me a steroid injection (dexamethasone) and told me to get an MRI to see what’s really going on.\n\nI’m going back tomorrow for a hearing test and possibly more steroid shots.\n\nI’m scared. I had mentally prepared myself for a slow hearing decline, not something this sudden. I’ve relied on my left ear for the past few years, The only ear I used to hear on the phone. Now I can barely hear from it. \n\nstapedectomy might help my right ear, but nothing is guaranteed.\n\nI’m confused, frustrated, hurting, and I don’t know what the future holds for me. There’s no hard of hearing or deaf community where I live, and even though my family has been supportive, I still feel incredibly alone.\n",
