       "  'thread_path_text': ['2yo learning signs appropriate?\\nhello! I’m going to start by saying that I nor anyone in my family or extended circle are Deaf or Hard of Hearing. for some reason this subreddit keeps popping up and after reading some posts I have a couple of questions I hope someone would be willing to answer because I am now super worried about being disrespectful.\\n\\nI have a 2yo. around 1yr we started teaching her some signs to help her communicate before her speech developed; it’s been a really “popular” thing to do in parenting the last several years I feel like, and now I feel terrible saying that like a laungage is a trend.\\n\\nI unfortunately have a couple chronic illnesses and rely on screen time more than I’d like as a tool to keep her safely occupied on bad days (please I’d appreciate no judgments on this). Ms Rachel has been her main one and while she has always demonstrated &amp; used some signs in her show (milk, more, help, please, + some toys/playing related words), her more recent episodes have been including more signing families. this has greatly expanded her signing vocabulary (like colors, fruits etc). my daughter probably uses about 50? signs with regularity now. we frequently rely on a website that always pops up first when we Google “____ ASL” when she starts using a new one because we have no idea if she’s right (she always is per the site haha).\\n\\nso for my questions:\\n\\n1) is it inappropriate for her to be learning/using signs just in day-to-day moments like this? I always thought it could be useful for her in the future to know more languages than just speaking English.  \\n\\n2) the past 2 months she has started putting sentences together while speaking, and the last 2-3 weeks she has been putting together 2 signs she knows to make more of a phrase? for example she’ll do the sign for “red” followed by the sign for “ball” when she sees a red ball. I have no idea if she’s following proper grammar (? I don’t know if this is the right word to use) so now I’m worried that that is inappropriate as well since we don’t know &amp; have no one to ask.\\n\\nI’m sorry this is so long. I’m sorry if I worded anything offensively. I would really appreciate any thoughts on this! she clearly enjoys it but I wouldn’t want to be disrespectful when she’s using them.'],\n",

Like I mentioned, he knows ASL as that\\'s how we communicate everyday. \\n\\nLately I\\'ve noticed him using very odd signs and he is sporadic with his grammar. I finally discovered that a \"teacher\" at story time \"knows ASL\" and has been \"correcting him\" when he signs. \\n\\nI contacted the library about this and they are defending the \"teacher\" saying she is fluent in sign. I have requested she not work with my son\\'s signing skills and leave him alone as she is clearly not fluent in ASL and has taught him bad habits along with harming the skills he currently has. \\n\\nI have already requested this persons transcripts proving she is fluent since she has been allowed to teach kids ASL. I have also made it clear it seems she knows SEE, which is different from ASL. When I attempted a conversation with her it was a complete mess. While I could somewhat follow her signs, she was lost with mine. \\n\\nI would pull my son from the program, but it\\'s part of his homeschooling to attend.

It really irritates me because this is a special episode where the guest is paid because it is for a “diverse voices” feature but run by two white hearing women. \\nI emailed them in September 2021 they replied: \\n\\n“Thank you so much for taking the time to provide this feedback. You are correct that the audio for this episode wasn't up to par, though we felt the content itself was important and warranted publication. We have been experimenting with different platforms to better enhance two separate audio channels (ie Allison and the guest) but have not had much luck. We will continue searching, though, and appreciate the reminder. Truly.\\n \\nAccessibility is hugely important to us. Our team of 3 is currently in the midst of migrating platforms (from Kajabi to Simplero), so that has taken a significant amount of time and energy. Once complete, we will refocus our attention to accessibility and the possibility of adding/editing subtitles (and/or transcripts) to all of our content. We appreciate your patience as we work to better ourselves. \\n \\nThank you again for your advice,\\nHaley”\\n\\n\\nIt is now 8 months later and still no transcript. I’m pretty sure accessibility is not important to them despite their claim.\\n\\n\\nMy question to you is:\\nAm I blowing this out of proportion? How do you feel about this?\\n\\nI’m thinking about following up with a more strongly worded email but I wanted to check in with others.\\n\\nIf you wanted to email too their email is help@abundancepracticebuilding.com\\n\\nEdited to add warning and email \\n\\n\\n https://open.spotify.com/episode/49ScTB0DjHxLkvVSGbMxER?si=87T1LvRmQm6SjuGjtF-oVg\"],\n",

His mom doesn\\'t even look at him when she\\'s talking to him, or has her hand over her mouth while she\\'s talking despite the fact that she knows he can\\'t understand a thing without seeing her mouth. \\n\\nA few years ago he expressed an interest in learning ASL. I was 110% on board from the start. Our first class was a local adult ed class with a hearing teacher (we didn\\'t know enough to know was frowned upon). The teacher spent 90% of the class speaking English and half the class writing things on the chalk board which meant he was facing away from all of us and my husband couldn\\'t lipread. Awesome, way to go leaving out the one deaf student in your class by being totally inaccessible. I was livid, my husband just shrugged and said \"eh, that\\'s how it is\". \\n\\nLast February we started a community class taught by a Deaf teacher. It was awesome, he was great, but not really coming from teaching background, he would teach us about 50 signs a class (one class he taught us the signs for every single country in the world, ha, it was a bit overwhelming). There was some basic grammar involved and it was overall a good intro class but stopped when the COVID-19 pandemic started. \\n\\nA friend who is an ASL interpreter told us if we were serious about learning, the best way was to take classes at a local university that has ASL Linguistics and ASL Interpreting programs. Last summer, with nothing else going on due to the pandemic, I figured I\\'d start classes. My husband didn\\'t want to  do homework over the summer so he was going to start in the Fall 2020 semester. He never did. I\\'m now 4 semesters in and still waiting for him to start. \\n\\nHe *says* he is still interested in learning and he liked it when I share what I\\'m learning in class or ask him to practice with me. I am now at a decently conversational level and have been doing chat sessions with native Deaf signers to practice regularly. I don\\'t think the two of us need to move to ASL 100% of the time for our communication, but it sure as heck can make life a lot easier for both of us, and I would love for us to have a method of communication that was equal effort for both of us and the burden is not all on him to keep up. \\n\\nThe question is: As a hearing person, I get that I don\\'t have any right to say how he should communicate. That\\'s fine. But I think it\\'s worth a shot, just take the intro class and see how he likes it. Communication is so essential to a marriage and I think if there is something we can add to our \"communication toolbox\" then it can\\'t hurt, right? We use what little ASL he does know when we are at the grocery stores now because masks have made lipreading impossible so I know he sees the benefit. Has anyone ever been in this situation? I don\\'t want to push him away from the idea of learning by asking him to take the course. I keep reminding him I started down this path because he wanted to learn. Any advice? Have any of you been in this situation before? Am I messing with a good thing by really wanting him to take a class? I just want him to know it doesn\\'t always have to be so hard and exhausting, there are other ways and I support him in whatever he wants. \\n\\n**TLDR**: My deaf husband wanted to learn ASL, we took classes, I am now 4 semesters in at a local college and while he says he still wants to learn, he is not signing up. How to I support him in knowing communication does not always have to be so frustrating and hard without totally pushing him away from learning ASL?'],\n",

       "  'thread_path_text': ['Jennica Pounds (aka DataRepublican), Ricky Taylor, and Rolling Stones - oh my!\\n#The Gist\\n\\nA controversy erupted in the deaf community after it was revealed that a Twitter user, DataRepublican, is a deaf person named Jennica Pounds.\\n\\nDataRepublican is known for spreading misinformation about federal money flow, often using it to justify the existence of DOGE (which, as we all know, is championed by Elon Musk). Recently, she did a round of interviews with right-wing media outlets, where she communicated in ASL with interpreters.\\n\\nHere are couple of interviews:\\n\\n[BlazeTV Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNSzVw_GX5c)\\n\\n[The Daily Moth\\'s coverage with another interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bZPlgJ2q-4)\\n\\nThis caught the attention of the notorious deaf vlogger, Ricky Taylor. \\n\\nHe spoke about this with some people in the deaf community and someone recognized her. That someone told him her real name. \\n\\nRicky made a Threads post where he named DataRepublican’s real identity—Jennica Pounds—which set off a firestorm on social media. Jennica responded with the following Twitter post:\\n\\n&gt;I have been doxxed. Rather than let others control the narrative, I am addressing this directly.\\n\\n&gt;My name is Jennica Pounds. I recently resigned from my job to pursue DOGE-adjacent efforts full-time. While my background check is still in progress, my ultimate goal is to work with the Administration to cut waste and improve efficiency.\\n\\n&gt;What began as a side hobby became a mission when I uncovered the role of NGOs in these issues. This is not about left or right. This is about us—the people.\\n\\n&gt;I gave up everything for this—my safety, my career—because I believe in what I am doing.\\n\\n&gt;I am 100% Deaf and nonverbal. My lack of signing fluency does not make me any less Deaf. It is a result of a language impairment related to my autism called expressive dysphasia, which affects my ability to construct language fluently in real-time. This impacts my signing, speaking, and even writing, though writing allows me more time to correct mistakes. My interpreter and I spend hours refining my talking points to ensure she conveys what I mean, not just what I say.\\n\\n&gt;I am Deaf. And being Deaf is not, and should never be, defined by one’s signing ability, particularly when there are medical conditions involved.\\n\\n&gt;I do not believe the Deaf community should be politically aligned with any party. A priority of mine has always been holding the Administration accountable to Deaf Americans, including advocating for policy changes such as allowing a second interpreter camera stream on television broadcasts. I will continue using my platform to push for these necessary changes.”\\n\\nHer post triggered a wave of MAGA supporters (mostly hearing people) who brigaded Ricky Taylor’s latest vlog about USAID, posting his home address, descriptions of his house and car, and threats against him—literally doxxing him.\\n\\nRicky responded in a hilariously defiant way, mocking them. \\n\\nThen, lo and behold, [Rolling Stone published an article about Jennica Pounds](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/elon-musk-data-republican-anonymous-data-expert-doge-tech-1235280817/). The article referenced a “deaf man” who named her—obviously referring to Ricky.\\n\\nThe Rolling Stone article was brutal in its criticism of Jennica’s role in spreading misinformation, which has been used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling key government functions. It also revealed details about her husband, home, distillery business, employment history, and a company she registered in Utah. Basically, it was a takedown piece.\\n\\nFYI - I heard Rolling Stone had been working on this article for a while, intending to be the first to expose Jennica’s identity—but Ricky beat them to it. That led to Rolling Stone reaching out to Ricky before publication, hence the vague reference to a “deaf man” who named her.\\n\\nAlso the timing of this post is really perfect because today [The New York Times published a full list of DOGE staffers](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/27/us/politics/doge-staff-list.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare). \\n\\nMAGA supporters are now crying about doxxing—the same way they did when Ricky exposed Jennica. But there’s plenty of online discussion about how these people are on the government payroll, impacting American citizens, meaning their identities should be public.\\n\\n#My Take on This Drama\\n\\n***My Sympathy for Jennica***\\n\\nFirst, I want to address the backlash Jennica faced over her ASL skills. Many in the deaf community mocked her signing in the interview videos and even questioned whether she was actually deaf.\\n\\nIf you know me, you know I despise when people—usually “D” Deaf community members—judge deaf people with below-average ASL skills as ‘not real Deaf.’\\n\\nJennica explained that she is a nonverbal autistic deaf person. I’ve met nonverbal autistic deaf people before, and I value them as part of our community. Just because her ASL isn’t fluent or native doesn’t mean she’s not deaf. I see Jennica as one of us.\\n\\n#However…\\n\\nThat said, I have zero sympathy for her role as a data/software engineer being used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling critical government functions that serve and protect disabled people—all of us here.\\n\\nJennica claims Ricky doxxed her. That’s bullshit. \\n\\nShe did public interviews showing her face. Yes, she wore sunglasses, but let’s be real—sunglasses aren’t a disguise.\\n\\nShe was already newsworthy in the deaf community for being a deaf data/software engineer praised by Elon Musk and Charlie Kirk. She boasted about their praise on her website. She also made it publicly known she was joining DOGE.\\n\\nIt was inevitable that deaf people would start talking and someone would recognize her. Our community is too small for it not to happen.\\n\\nAnd let’s not forget Rolling Stone’s article. Her endeavors with \"DataRepublicans\" were public enough to attract the attention from a major publication company. They went way deeper in exposing her background. Their criticism of Jennica was completely valid. That article was coming out regardless of Ricky\\'s post. \\n\\nBy choosing to align herself with this effort, Jennica should have expected public scrutiny.\\n\\n#In Conclusion…\\n\\nRicky did nothing wrong by naming her. It was going to happen anyway.\\n\\nAnd it’s beyond hypocritical for right-wingers to accuse him of doxxing when they literally doxxed Ricky.\\n\\nSo here we are—a deaf person in our community has aligned herself with an administration that is actively working against us.'],\n",

My wife really wants to give an over-looked child a second chance at a normal life, but I'm not sure that as two hearing parents, of the same gender, would be the best way. I also know that she and I do, very much, want at least one child to make us a family.

Our teacher is brilliant and we're lucky to have each other to practise with.  However, I am aware that our only practice at understanding BSL is from each other or our teacher; we are obviously quite rubbish and our teacher is super-supportive, slow and clear.  We'd like to start trying to get more comfortable with understanding BSL as it's actually used.  I wondered if watching tv programmes with signing would help?  I seem to remember Hollyoaks having a late night showing which was signed and I accidentally series-linked The Great British Sewing Bee's signed version when it was last on (which was before we were learning, sadly).  I don't want to watch Hollyoaks and TGBSB has finished.  Does anyone know of any halfway-decent programmes which have a signed version on tv that I could record (I suspect it'll be on in the middle of the night) or how to find out when signed versions are on?  I did a bit of googling and couldn't find anything useful - I mostly ended up with signed programmes online which were BSL presented with English subtitles (which is no good because I can't read the subtitles and watch the signing at the same time!).  I need English being spoken and BSL being signed, so that I can listen to the words but watch the signing.  I realise this is a long-winded post, sorry, but I'm hoping someone can direct me to something on Sky, Netflix or Amazon Prime.  Thanks!\"],\n",

       "  'thread_path_text': ['The Free ASL Resources and FAQ Thread!\\nHello!  I\\'m here to help as much as I can, but this is not a comprehensive guide or a substitute for classes.  This is a quick resource for people looking for answers to some very commonly asked questions.  I\\'ve included the information as I know it, but it doesn\\'t mean it\\'s The Truth; my experiences and understanding will vary from others\\', but this will give you a good enough introduction.  There\\'s so much more I\\'d love to teach you, but I\\'m going to stick to the FAQs.\\n\\n#Where can I learn ASL online for free?\\n\\nMy personal favourite is easily http://www.lifeprint.com (which is mirrored at http://asluniversity.com as well).  The guy who built the site, Dr. Bill Vicars, is Deaf and is a phenomenal teacher.  He teaches primarily west-coast dialect (California, Washington common signs) but makes mention of other dialects (east-coast, Texas) when he can.  In addition to teaching vocabulary, he teaches about Deaf culture (more on this in a moment).  Other notable resources are:\\n\\n- http://www.signlanguage101.com/ \\n- https://www.signschool.com/\\n- Bill Vicars: https://youtube.com/@sign-language\\n- Learn How to Sign: https://youtube.com/@LearnHowtoSign\\n\\n#What\\'s the sign for ... ?\\n\\nThe short answer is \"it depends.\"  Sometimes.  It depends sometimes.  \\n\\nThe long answer is that signs will vary.  Signs can be different depending on region, as I mentioned before, so just because you see it one way doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s the *only* way.  (Don\\'t make this mistake; a lot of hearing students can get cocky and start correcting others.)  Signs can also change depending on context.  The signs for \"back\" in \"My back hurts\" and \"Let\\'s go back home\" are completely different.  \\n\\nAlso, this is very important: **ASL is not English!**  It is its own language, as different from English as is Klingon.  ASL has its own grammar structure, own idioms, own slang.  Signs are also *not words* like in the English sense.  Signs are a lot more about intent, concepts, and ideas.  For example, if you\\'re trying to learn how to sign \"Back off!\" I can promise you that you will not need any sign for \"back\" nor \"off.\"  You\\'re learning how to speak, and think, in another language, and using English just won\\'t do.  \\n\\nNow, with all that said, here are some online dictionaries (I suggest you look at them all so you\\'re familiar with the different variations of your sign):\\n\\n- http://www.lifeprint.com/dictionary.htm\\n- https://aslpro.cc/\\n- https://www.signingsavvy.com/\\n- http://www.handspeak.com/word/\\n- https://www.startasl.com/american-sign-language-dictionary.html\\n\\n\\n#Does it matter what hand I sign with?\\n\\nYes.  Consistently use your main, dominant hand.  If you\\'re right-handed, use your right.  If you\\'re left-handed, use your left.  If you\\'re ambidextrous, then pick one and maintain it.  Switching dominant hands while signing would be like alternating screaming and whispering while speaking.\\n\\n#Are American Sign Language and British Sign Language the same?\\n\\nAre English and Japanese the same?  ASL is not English, so stop thinking of it like English!  :)  In fact, ASL is derived from French Sign Language, which evolved independently of British Sign Language, and the two are mostly different (in fact, less than 30% of the signs are even remotely similar).  There are dozens and dozens of sign languages in the world, and even in the United States ASL is not the only one used.\\n\\n#Why do you keep capitalizing \"Deaf\"?\\n\\nWe use \"little-d\" deaf to mean someone who physically can\\'t hear well.  We use \"big-D\" Deaf to mean someone who is *culturally deaf*.  Now an interesting bit: someone who is Deaf does not have to be deaf, and someone who is deaf does not have to be Deaf!  For instance, children of deaf adults (CODAs) are very often Deaf but hearing.  Many people are physically deaf but aren\\'t part of Deaf culture.  It\\'s about how a person self identifies and where their culture lies more than it does with anything physical.\\n\\n#What\\'s this \"Deaf Culture\" you keep mentioning?\\n\\nIt\\'d take me hours to explain it all, and I usually spread it over my entire 12-week class.  In short, many deaf people, specifically those who identify as Deaf, live in a different culture than you do.  Yes, they\\'re from your country, they drink Starbucks and they sit in traffic, but they have their own distinct culture.  Obviously this includes language (and communicating in real ASL is so different than talking in English that it\\'s hard to describe), but that different method of communication, that different way of thinking, is only part of Deaf culture. Things that are normal in one culture can be very strange the another.  (My favourite, probably, is talking with your mouth full.  In hearing culture, that\\'s a big no-no and your mother will look at you very cross.  In Deaf culture, that\\'s totally acceptable!  Stuff your face and then free your hands for conversation, it\\'s great!  So much more efficient!) Morality and ethics are shaped by our cultural values.  There are aspects of Deaf culture which would be considered blunt or rude in hearing culture, and conversely there are a lot of things normal in hearing culture which are strange or disrespectful in Deaf culture (such as talking to someone\\'s back, or looking around during a conversation).  It\\'s important to be aware of and respectful of other cultures, including Deaf culture, and, when possible, to learn about them.  Not only will it ingratiate you to people of that culture, but it\\'ll better yourself as a person as well.\\n\\n#Isn\\'t it wrong to say \"deaf\"?  Shouldn\\'t I say \"hearing impaired\" or \"hard of hearing\"?\\n\\nNope, and nope.  Now, before I continue, I\\'ll let you know that not everyone agrees with me, and I\\'m speaking in a *general* sense.  Big-D Deaf people prefer the term \"deaf\" above any other.  (It\\'s how a US Senator might feel being called \"American.\"  Some people would take it as an insult, but it\\'s just a matter of fact or pride for the Senator.)\\n\\nWhether people identify themselves as \"deaf\" or \"hard of hearing\" (often seen as HoH) is often a matter of self identity, and while it can correlate to level of ability to hear, it isn\\'t caused by it.  I\\'ll explain later.  Deafies who are a part of Deaf culture will almost always call themselves \"deaf,\" and those who aren\\'t a part of Deaf culture will usually go by \"hard of hearing\" (or more rarely \"hearing impaired\").  In general, those who are less physically deaf, or who were raised strictly in hearing culture, will tend to gravitate toward hearing culture, despite the numerous difficulties.  These people will commonly say they are \"hard of hearing\" since \"deaf\" still has a social stigma in hearing culture.  Those who are less capable of integrating with hearing culture, or who were introduced to or raised in a Deaf environment, will usually prefer to be called \"deaf\" and can sometimes take one of the other terms as a slight offense.\\n\\nIn general, it\\'s almost never correct to say \"hearing impaired.\"  I was taught that it was coined by a US Senator who wanted to protect deaf people\\'s feelings from something that didn\\'t offend them in the first place, and it was never accepted by Deaf (the core reason being that we don\\'t believe being deaf is an impairment; it\\'d be like if I said you were \"Deaf impaired.\"  You don\\'t feel impaired, do you, however much I might think it\\'s true?) in general.  In fact, it\\'s safe if you never use this phrase again.\\n\\nWhen in doubt though, just ask!  \"Hey, do you prefer \\'deaf\\' or \\'hard of hearing\\'?\"  See, it\\'s not that hard.  :)\\n\\n#I saw a sign that looks like this ..., what does it mean?\\nWe\\'re happy to help with these kinds of questions.  I treat it like a quiz show game.  However, if you\\'re new to this, you may not know how to describe a sign very well, so let me introduce you to signs!\\n\\nA sign consists of five parts:\\n\\n1. Hand shape: Are the fingers making an \"O\"?  Were the thumb and middle-finger touching?  If you know some basic ASL, you can use hand shape identifiers, such as \"A hand shape\" or \"8 hand shape\".\\n2. Position: Where in relation to the body was the sign?  Near the chest?  Near the eyes?  Was the palm facing up, down, toward the signer?\\n3. Movement: How did the sign move or change?  Was it pushing away from the body?  Was it a small circle in space?\\n4. Non-manual markers: What else was happening with the signer\\'s body?  What did her face look like? Was he moving his body, or shrugging?  What was the emotion the signer was portraying?\\n5. Context: What else was happening before or after the sign.  Were there other signs you recognized? Do you know the subject that the signer was communicating about?\\n\\n#Where can I find a Deaf group in my area?\\nWhere\\'s your area?  Most major cities have Deaf hubs.  San Francisco, Seattle, Austin, and New York all have strong, vibrant, rich Deaf communities.  Smaller cities may have meet ups or the like, but they can be harder to track down.  Your best bet is to turn to Google or Facebook and search for Deaf events in your area.  \"Deaf coffee night\" is an event held nationwide.  People in the community get together for a night or two each month, usually at a coffee shop with good lighting and ample seating, just for the purpose of seeing friends and making new ones.  Local colleges or universities will often have ASL/Deaf clubs and usually host student-friendly ASL events, so check with the ASL teachers or the ASL campus group, if it exists.\\n\\n#Can I still ask questions here?\\nYes!  Yes!  1000 times yes!  Many of us are here to help, and anything we can do to help teach you about the language and the culture we\\'re happy to do.\\n\\n#Will you do my homework for me?\\nNope.  Nope.  1000 times nope.  It\\'s obvious when students are looking for someone to do their homework for them, and we\\'re not gonna help you out.  If you\\'re here to learn instead, then welcome! Come make some new friends.  :)'],\n",

We have some basic rules, I don\\'t want to police the content here but if you have any other suggestions or requests let me know.\\n2. User flairs are now available (but not mandatory) - there should be one to cover any level but there\\'s also the option to customise one if you would prefer something different, feel free to have fun with it (but try to keep it appropriate!) \\n3. Post flairs are also available - again, not ALWAYS mandatory, but it will help people who want to search for specific content to find it if posts are flaired. There is also a custom post flair if you want to post something and don\\'t feel like anything else fits.\\n4. Post flairs WILL be mandatory for SSE and Non-BSL content, as we have a large number of beginners here and it\\'s best to avoid confusion \\n5. The \"Non-BSL Content\" flair is intended to be used for images or videos of foreign sign languages used for educational purposes or comparison discussions, not for completely unrelated content\\n6. We have a beginners guide and a resource list available (and I fixed the typos I found,  let me know if you find anything wrong with them)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nContent suggestions:\\n\\nI\\'ve been trying to post a bit of varied content, but we\\'ve got a short list of suggestions to see what people think and whether any of them are unwanted\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n1. Polls and (related) discussions - fairly self explanatory, some community polls followed up by discussions about the results of them, and also themed discussion threads\\n2. \"Sign of the week\" - this will either be a link from the SignBSL video dictionary or a photograph from a paper sign dictionary\\n3. SignHealth Coronavirus updates - I am cautious that people are probably fed up with covid already so I\\'m not planning to post all of them as they are quite frequent. SignHealth also do other medical-related videos but I\\'m not sure if this would appeal to anyone that wasn\\'t intending to go into that are of work?\\n4. Royal Association of the Deaf do cooking videos from time to time, which could be a fun thing for people who like a more practical (and edible) BSL homework/practice\\n5. Signed stories - perhaps more interesting to people who have or work with children, or maybe some beginners looking for more basic stories \\n6. Deaf news - written or signed articles relating to the Deaf community or Deaf rights/issues\\n7. Deaf culture and history \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAny ideas, feedback, opinions, or suggestions are welcome, hopefully we can get the community to engage a little bit more and get some other people comfortable to share and post things!'],\n",

Cleaning up, like correcting spelling, grammar, putting in missing words, etc.\\n\\nLike, you can put a video through automatic captions and then clean up the captions, which would make this a deaf-friendly career, right?\\n\\nAnyway, YouTube is almost unwatchable now.

       "  'thread_path_text': ['The Free ASL Resources and FAQ Thread!\\nHello!  I\\'m here to help as much as I can, but this is not a comprehensive guide or a substitute for classes.  This is a quick resource for people looking for answers to some very commonly asked questions.  I\\'ve included the information as I know it, but it doesn\\'t mean it\\'s The Truth; my experiences and understanding will vary from others\\', but this will give you a good enough introduction.  There\\'s so much more I\\'d love to teach you, but I\\'m going to stick to the FAQs.\\n\\n#Where can I learn ASL online for free?\\n\\nMy personal favourite is easily http://www.lifeprint.com (which is mirrored at http://asluniversity.com as well).  The guy who built the site, Dr. Bill Vicars, is Deaf and is a phenomenal teacher.  He teaches primarily west-coast dialect (California, Washington common signs) but makes mention of other dialects (east-coast, Texas) when he can.  In addition to teaching vocabulary, he teaches about Deaf culture (more on this in a moment).  Other notable resources are:\\n\\n- http://www.signlanguage101.com/ \\n- https://www.signschool.com/\\n- Bill Vicars: https://youtube.com/@sign-language\\n- Learn How to Sign: https://youtube.com/@LearnHowtoSign\\n\\n#What\\'s the sign for ... ?\\n\\nThe short answer is \"it depends.\"  Sometimes.  It depends sometimes.  \\n\\nThe long answer is that signs will vary.  Signs can be different depending on region, as I mentioned before, so just because you see it one way doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s the *only* way.  (Don\\'t make this mistake; a lot of hearing students can get cocky and start correcting others.)  Signs can also change depending on context.  The signs for \"back\" in \"My back hurts\" and \"Let\\'s go back home\" are completely different.  \\n\\nAlso, this is very important: **ASL is not English!**  It is its own language, as different from English as is Klingon.  ASL has its own grammar structure, own idioms, own slang.  Signs are also *not words* like in the English sense.  Signs are a lot more about intent, concepts, and ideas.  For example, if you\\'re trying to learn how to sign \"Back off!\" I can promise you that you will not need any sign for \"back\" nor \"off.\"  You\\'re learning how to speak, and think, in another language, and using English just won\\'t do.  \\n\\nNow, with all that said, here are some online dictionaries (I suggest you look at them all so you\\'re familiar with the different variations of your sign):\\n\\n- http://www.lifeprint.com/dictionary.htm\\n- https://aslpro.cc/\\n- https://www.signingsavvy.com/\\n- http://www.handspeak.com/word/\\n- https://www.startasl.com/american-sign-language-dictionary.html\\n\\n\\n#Does it matter what hand I sign with?\\n\\nYes.  Consistently use your main, dominant hand.  If you\\'re right-handed, use your right.  If you\\'re left-handed, use your left.  If you\\'re ambidextrous, then pick one and maintain it.  Switching dominant hands while signing would be like alternating screaming and whispering while speaking.\\n\\n#Are American Sign Language and British Sign Language the same?\\n\\nAre English and Japanese the same?  ASL is not English, so stop thinking of it like English!  :)  In fact, ASL is derived from French Sign Language, which evolved independently of British Sign Language, and the two are mostly different (in fact, less than 30% of the signs are even remotely similar).  There are dozens and dozens of sign languages in the world, and even in the United States ASL is not the only one used.\\n\\n#Why do you keep capitalizing \"Deaf\"?\\n\\nWe use \"little-d\" deaf to mean someone who physically can\\'t hear well.  We use \"big-D\" Deaf to mean someone who is *culturally deaf*.  Now an interesting bit: someone who is Deaf does not have to be deaf, and someone who is deaf does not have to be Deaf!  For instance, children of deaf adults (CODAs) are very often Deaf but hearing.  Many people are physically deaf but aren\\'t part of Deaf culture.  It\\'s about how a person self identifies and where their culture lies more than it does with anything physical.\\n\\n#What\\'s this \"Deaf Culture\" you keep mentioning?\\n\\nIt\\'d take me hours to explain it all, and I usually spread it over my entire 12-week class.  In short, many deaf people, specifically those who identify as Deaf, live in a different culture than you do.  Yes, they\\'re from your country, they drink Starbucks and they sit in traffic, but they have their own distinct culture.  Obviously this includes language (and communicating in real ASL is so different than talking in English that it\\'s hard to describe), but that different method of communication, that different way of thinking, is only part of Deaf culture. Things that are normal in one culture can be very strange the another.  (My favourite, probably, is talking with your mouth full.  In hearing culture, that\\'s a big no-no and your mother will look at you very cross.  In Deaf culture, that\\'s totally acceptable!  Stuff your face and then free your hands for conversation, it\\'s great!  So much more efficient!) Morality and ethics are shaped by our cultural values.  There are aspects of Deaf culture which would be considered blunt or rude in hearing culture, and conversely there are a lot of things normal in hearing culture which are strange or disrespectful in Deaf culture (such as talking to someone\\'s back, or looking around during a conversation).  It\\'s important to be aware of and respectful of other cultures, including Deaf culture, and, when possible, to learn about them.  Not only will it ingratiate you to people of that culture, but it\\'ll better yourself as a person as well.\\n\\n#Isn\\'t it wrong to say \"deaf\"?  Shouldn\\'t I say \"hearing impaired\" or \"hard of hearing\"?\\n\\nNope, and nope.  Now, before I continue, I\\'ll let you know that not everyone agrees with me, and I\\'m speaking in a *general* sense.  Big-D Deaf people prefer the term \"deaf\" above any other.  (It\\'s how a US Senator might feel being called \"American.\"  Some people would take it as an insult, but it\\'s just a matter of fact or pride for the Senator.)\\n\\nWhether people identify themselves as \"deaf\" or \"hard of hearing\" (often seen as HoH) is often a matter of self identity, and while it can correlate to level of ability to hear, it isn\\'t caused by it.  I\\'ll explain later.  Deafies who are a part of Deaf culture will almost always call themselves \"deaf,\" and those who aren\\'t a part of Deaf culture will usually go by \"hard of hearing\" (or more rarely \"hearing impaired\").  In general, those who are less physically deaf, or who were raised strictly in hearing culture, will tend to gravitate toward hearing culture, despite the numerous difficulties.  These people will commonly say they are \"hard of hearing\" since \"deaf\" still has a social stigma in hearing culture.  Those who are less capable of integrating with hearing culture, or who were introduced to or raised in a Deaf environment, will usually prefer to be called \"deaf\" and can sometimes take one of the other terms as a slight offense.\\n\\nIn general, it\\'s almost never correct to say \"hearing impaired.\"  I was taught that it was coined by a US Senator who wanted to protect deaf people\\'s feelings from something that didn\\'t offend them in the first place, and it was never accepted by Deaf (the core reason being that we don\\'t believe being deaf is an impairment; it\\'d be like if I said you were \"Deaf impaired.\"  You don\\'t feel impaired, do you, however much I might think it\\'s true?) in general.  In fact, it\\'s safe if you never use this phrase again.\\n\\nWhen in doubt though, just ask!  \"Hey, do you prefer \\'deaf\\' or \\'hard of hearing\\'?\"  See, it\\'s not that hard.  :)\\n\\n#I saw a sign that looks like this ..., what does it mean?\\nWe\\'re happy to help with these kinds of questions.  I treat it like a quiz show game.  However, if you\\'re new to this, you may not know how to describe a sign very well, so let me introduce you to signs!\\n\\nA sign consists of five parts:\\n\\n1. Hand shape: Are the fingers making an \"O\"?  Were the thumb and middle-finger touching?  If you know some basic ASL, you can use hand shape identifiers, such as \"A hand shape\" or \"8 hand shape\".\\n2. Position: Where in relation to the body was the sign?  Near the chest?  Near the eyes?  Was the palm facing up, down, toward the signer?\\n3. Movement: How did the sign move or change?  Was it pushing away from the body?  Was it a small circle in space?\\n4. Non-manual markers: What else was happening with the signer\\'s body?  What did her face look like? Was he moving his body, or shrugging?  What was the emotion the signer was portraying?\\n5. Context: What else was happening before or after the sign.  Were there other signs you recognized? Do you know the subject that the signer was communicating about?\\n\\n#Where can I find a Deaf group in my area?\\nWhere\\'s your area?  Most major cities have Deaf hubs.  San Francisco, Seattle, Austin, and New York all have strong, vibrant, rich Deaf communities.  Smaller cities may have meet ups or the like, but they can be harder to track down.  Your best bet is to turn to Google or Facebook and search for Deaf events in your area.  \"Deaf coffee night\" is an event held nationwide.  People in the community get together for a night or two each month, usually at a coffee shop with good lighting and ample seating, just for the purpose of seeing friends and making new ones.  Local colleges or universities will often have ASL/Deaf clubs and usually host student-friendly ASL events, so check with the ASL teachers or the ASL campus group, if it exists.\\n\\n#Can I still ask questions here?\\nYes!  Yes!  1000 times yes!  Many of us are here to help, and anything we can do to help teach you about the language and the culture we\\'re happy to do.\\n\\n#Will you do my homework for me?\\nNope.  Nope.  1000 times nope.  It\\'s obvious when students are looking for someone to do their homework for them, and we\\'re not gonna help you out.  If you\\'re here to learn instead, then welcome!

       "  'thread_path_text': ['Charlie Kirk\\'s Name Sign is \"Cock Penis.\" Sign. His. Name.\\n#Let’s Set the Stage First\\n\\nWildfires ravaged the Los Angeles area between January 7 and January 31 of this year.\\n\\nOn January 8, during that day’s episode of The Charlie Kirk Show, Charlie Kirk made a comment suggesting that ASL interpreters on TV broadcasts are distracting and should be eliminated.\\n\\nThe deaf community responded swiftly and with near-unity. Many scoffed at Kirk and called him an idiot for not understanding that ASL is a primary language for many deaf people—and that access to it is essential.\\n\\n#The Spark… \\n\\nLast week, Charlie Kirk made a stop at Oklahoma State University (OSU) as part of his American Comeback Tour.\\n\\nHe held his usual media event, where he interacted directly with the audience. Logan Evans, a local deaf person, seized the opportunity to confront Kirk about his wildfire-era comments suggesting ASL interpreters should be removed because closed captions already exist.\\n\\nKirk responded in a surprisingly conciliatory way. He said that after seeing the deaf community’s reaction, he reached out to a deaf person who explained that ASL is many deaf individuals’ primary language. Therefore, ASL interpreters on emergency broadcasts are critical for delivering life-saving information.\\n\\nKirk claimed he had learned from the experience—and that he now empathizes with the need for interpreter access during emergencies.\\n\\nThis was unexpected, especially given Kirk’s typically combative personality. Most people assumed he’d double down.\\n\\nLogan and Kirk exchanged a few more comments. Then, at the end, Logan told Kirk he’d like to give him a sign name.\\n\\nThe sign name Logan gave him was an initialized combination of the letters “C” and “K” on the nose.\\n\\nBefore moving on further, I want to acknowledge the diversity of this subreddit. Not all of us are immersed in the ASL-based Deaf world—so I’ll break it down clearly.\\n\\nIn ASL, the sign name Logan gave Charlie Kirk breaks down as:\\n\\n**Cock** – The letter “C” tapped on or near the nose can be interpreted as “cock.” It’s not a standard or widely accepted sign for “cock,” but in this context, that’s the intended meaning.\\n\\n**Penis** –  The handshape for “K” is very similar to “P.” In ASL, the official sign for “penis” is the letter “P” on the nose. So signing “K” on the nose closely resembles that—effectively making it a visual pun.\\n\\nSo the sign name Logan gave Kirk? It translates in ASL to: “Cock Penis.”\\n\\n#…That Ignited the Deaf Community!\\n\\nCharlie Kirk posted the clip of his exchange with Logan Evans on YouTube, and it quickly went viral within the deaf community.\\n\\nAt first, the reaction—particularly among left-leaning deaf folks—was overwhelmingly positive. Many found the sign name hilarious. In online discussions, people joked that Logan had become a legend for giving Kirk such a title.\\n\\nThen things got complicated.\\n\\nLogan posted [a vlog on his Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1YXQMFYDTg/) apologizing to the community for his actions.\\n\\n(Author’s note: I know this sub expects a summary when linking to ASL vlogs without captions. In this case, Logan provided a transcript in the post. It’s a near-exact English translation of what he signed—so that’s the accessibility option for anyone who needs it.)\\n\\nIt turns out Logan is an ASL professor at Oklahoma State University—the same campus where he confronted Charlie Kirk. The community also learned he’s the president of the Oklahoma Association of the Deaf, a state chapter affiliated with NAD.\\n\\n#A Breakdown of Logan’s Apology\\n\\nThere are quite a few layers to Logan’s apology.\\n\\nCommon sense suggests that he likely issued the public apology because his job as a professor at Oklahoma State University may be in jeopardy. That much is understandable. It’s also likely he apologized because he upset members of the Oklahoma Association of the Deaf—a lot of them lean politically to the right.\\n\\nHowever, it wasn’t the “Cock Penis” sign name itself that truly sparked the current discourse in the deaf community. It was the apology.\\n\\nLogan didn’t just apologize for appearing in a recorded video at a Charlie Kirk event and giving him that sign name. He apologized for upsetting and “harming” the deaf community as a whole.\\n\\nAnd that’s what really ignited the conversation.\\n\\nSeveral members of the deaf community felt he shouldn’t have apologized to the right-leaning segment of the community—especially those who support Charlie Kirk and his well-documented history of hateful rhetoric. That part of the community, many argued, has long tolerated or even endorsed Kirk’s racism, sexism, anti-LGBTQ (especially anti-trans), and xenophobic views.\\n\\nPersonally, I agree with that stance.\\n\\nI was fine with the idea of Logan apologizing for participating in a media event and giving Charlie Kirk the “Cock Penis” sign name. That was, no question, a lapse in professional judgment. He should have foreseen that doing so would cross a line—especially considering his role as president of the Oklahoma Association of the Deaf. (And let’s be real: we all know how red Oklahoma is.)\\n\\nBut I definitely side-eyed how *far* Logan took his apology. He apologized to the entire deaf community.\\n\\n#The Deaf Community’s Responses to Logan’s Apology\\n\\nOver the weekend, several prominent deaf vloggers posted their thoughts on the incident. In this section, I’ll break down their responses in the order they appeared.\\n\\n(Author\\'s note: I want to respect this subreddit’s rule about linking ASL vlogs without captions. When I reference these vlogs, I’ll provide written summaries—or paraphrase them in simple terms to keep it accessible and easy to follow.)\\n\\n**The Beginning – The First Response:**\\n\\nTim Gough reposted Logan Evans’ apology along with a text-based response on Facebook.\\n\\n*Context:* Tim is a deaf professor at an Interpreter Training Program (ITP) at a college in California. He occasionally posts public vlogs addressing issues in the deaf community.\\n\\nHere’s what Tim Gough wrote:\\n\\n&gt;I would not accept his apology.\\n\\n&gt;That name sign was not fair, especially after Charlie Kirk listened and apologized for his ignorance.\\n\\n&gt;Trump and Elon Musk listen to people like Charlie Kirk. Can you imagine him telling them he was getting screwed with an inappropriate name sign?\\n\\n&gt;He has an accountability to the highest level as somebody who works in the profession.”\\n\\n**The Rising Response – The Second Response:**\\n\\nTamera Gaudet-Doody responded to Tim Gough’s post with [a vlog of her own](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1ANSbhWrwC/).\\n\\n*Context:* Tamera currently runs a YouTube channel where she frequently vlogs about the Trump administration. She rose to prominence in the deaf community when she launched a platform called “ROAR” (Re-framing Our ASL Rights)—created in protest of LEAD-K’s partnership with the AG Bell Association in collecting language deprivation data. Tamera was strongly opposed to any affiliation between pro-ASL organizations and AG Bell. (This incident, which happened just before the pandemic, deserves its own post—maybe another time.)\\n\\n*Vlog Summary:*\\n\\nTamera’s vlog echoed a common frustration among left-leaning individuals: that Democrats often hold themselves to higher standards than they demand from Republicans. She argued that this double standard must end.\\n\\nShe expressed sympathy for Logan’s situation and saw nothing wrong with the sign name he gave Kirk. In fact, she found it hilarious.\\n\\nTamera highlighted the consistently destructive language used by the political right against liberal and marginalized communities, and she welcomed Logan Evans to the broader fight against the Trump administration.\\n\\n**The Climax – The Third Response:**\\n\\nTim Gough replied to Tamera with[ a vlog of his own.](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1989QVWwyW/)\\n\\n*Vlog Summary:*\\n\\nTim opened by referencing Michelle Obama’s famous quote: “When they go low, we go high.”\\n\\nHe then revealed that he follows Charlie Kirk on social media and enjoys Kirk’s challenges to left-leaning views.\\n\\nThe heart of Tim’s vlog was his surprise that Charlie Kirk—someone aligned with Trump and Elon Musk—had shown even a moment of reflection and expressed understanding about the importance of ASL interpreters in emergency broadcasts. Tim described Kirk’s reaction as “beautiful” and suggested it could be a step toward building a bridge between the Trump/Musk world and the deaf community.\\n\\nTim went on to call Logan an arrogant and attention-seeking deaf person who exploited the moment to assign an inappropriate name sign to Charlie Kirk.\\n\\nHe criticized Logan’s actions in the context of his professional roles—as a university professor and as president of a deaf organization. Tim argued that when a deaf person gives a hearing person a sign name, that act carries weight and is often perceived as representing the broader deaf community.\\n\\nAccording to Tim, the “Cock Penis” name sign was politically motivated and didn’t reflect the values of half the deaf community. He concluded by laying out his reasons for refusing to forgive Logan Evans.\\n\\n#Elvis Zornoza\\n\\nElvis Zornoza posted [a vlog in support of Tim Gough’s previous vlog.](https://www.facebook.com/reel/680353067739297)\\n\\n*Context:* Elvis is an emerging deaf social media personality. While I believe he’s originally from Kentucky, he spent most of his life in California. He built his reputation by vlogging about drama and issues within the California School for the Deaf in Fremont (near San Francisco) and the broader Bay Area deaf community. Over time, he became something of a controversial figure—eventually leaving for Southern California in a kind of self-imposed exile before enrolling at Gallaudet University earlier this year.\\n\\nHe now posts regularly on TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram, often about his experiences at Gallaudet. I also believe he briefly attended the university in the 1980s or 1990s, but left after his partner became pregnant. He raised his children and, now that they’re grown, has returned to pursue a degree.\\n\\n*Vlog Summary:*\\n\\n(Author’s note: This is the vlog that boils my blood the most.)\\n\\nTo be blunt, Elvis Zornoza is painfully ignorant, oblivious, and near-sighted—not only about Charlie Kirk as a person, but also about the full context of what Turning Point USA represents. He shows no understanding of the organization’s deep involvement in the Trump-era political landscape, nor of how it has functioned as a pipeline connecting American youth with far-right extremism.\\n\\nAfter a short intro explaining what his Facebook reel would cover, Elvis brushed off the politics entirely. He said it didn’t matter whether Charlie Kirk was left-leaning or right-leaning—because, in Elvis’s view, that wasn’t the point.\\n\\nThe point, according to Elvis, was that Charlie Kirk is the founder of Turning Point USA—which Elvis emphasized is a “national student movement!” He punctuated the moment with an enthusiastic:\\n\\n“Whoa!”\\n\\nFrom there, Elvis echoed Tim Gough’s stance, calling Logan “arrogant” for ruining what he saw as a golden opportunity: bringing Turning Point USA’s platform to the deaf community, and introducing Kirk to deaf needs—only to squander it with the “Cock Penis” sign name.\\n\\nAnd then Elvis took it to a whole new level of absurdity.\\n\\nHe said Logan’s apology wasn’t enough. In his view, Logan should now go even further—he should get deeply involved with Turning Point USA. Elvis suggested that Logan become the deaf ambassador for Charlie Kirk and Turning Point USA, and that he use that role to bring the deaf community closer to the Trump administration.\\n\\nLet me make one thing very clear. Elvis has no known history of engaging with or supporting right-wing politics. His social media content has been focused almost exclusively on issues affecting the pro-ASL deaf community. From what I’ve seen, he seems to lean left.\\n\\nHe’s just… completely and dangerously uninformed on this topic.\\n\\n#Wildfire Now\\n\\nAt this point, the situation has fully ignited across the deaf community—it’s everywhere. The discourse isn’t dying down anytime soon. Many are now quietly anticipating some kind of public response from the Oklahoma community, especially regarding Logan Evans and the two positions of power he currently holds:\\n\\n-His job as a teacher\\n\\n-His seat as President of the Oklahoma Association of the Deaf (OAD)\\n\\n#Here are some other vlogs that have recently emerged:\\n\\nTim Gough made [a follow-up vlog.](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/16G71hXYUV/)\\n\\n(Author’s note: I honestly don’t think this is worth summarizing. I’m just putting it here for those who want to watch it.)\\n\\n[Joy Maisel](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/19uYDH46FF/) and [Tar Burt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nwUSZlGwvk) each made vlogs expressing full-throated support for Charlie Kirk’s new sign name—declaring they will happily embrace “Cock Penis” as his official ASL identity.\\n\\n#Ricky Taylor\\n\\nRicky Taylor, a man who truly needs no introduction, posted three vlogs about the fiasco. You can watch them [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJV0t_TBF6s), [here](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/15AFrESQts/), and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWR6nS1JfNU). Below is a synthesized summary of all three.\\n\\nRicky didn’t hold back.\\n\\nHe directly confronted Tim Gough (author’s note: they know each other personally) and delivered a searing takedown. Ricky tore Tim apart for completely missing the point of what was being said—that Charlie Kirk’s “moment of openness” toward the deaf community wasn’t genuine, and to treat it as a turning point was naive at best.\\n\\nIn one of the most memorable moments, Ricky spurred a phrase that stuck with me:\\n\\nTim—and by extension, a big chunk of the deaf community—are goldfish living in a fishbowl.\\n\\nI’ll expand on this analogy below, but it was devastatingly accurate.\\n\\nHe then launched into a blistering critique of Charlie Kirk’s long and well-documented history of inflammatory rhetoric toward marginalized communities—including immigrants, BIPOC folks, disabled people, and the LGBTQ+ community. To suggest Charlie Kirk is now an ally just because he was humble in his response to Logan? Please.\\n\\n#Wesley Arey\\n\\nThe deaf community’s beloved trash god, Wesley Arey, [made a vlog.](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/18rie1b1FA/)\\n\\nThe summary is simple:\\n\\nHe fooled around with his motorcycle at home, repeatedly said “Cock Penis” in a variety of obscenely creative ways, and that was the vlog.\\n\\nI would never admit this in public, but this is Reddit, so screw it —\\nIt’s been a while since I laughed that hard.\\n\\n#The “Goldfishes in a Fishbowl” Analogy\\n\\nI love this analogy.\\n\\nImagine a beach house on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean. On a windowsill inside, there’s a little fishbowl with a couple of goldfish swimming in circles.\\n\\nNow ask yourself: do those goldfish live in water? Yes. But can they truly grasp what the ocean is? No. Despite living their entire lives in an aquatic environment, their world is defined by the tight, controlled space of that fishbowl—maybe even ending in a flush down the toilet.\\n\\nThat’s exactly how it feels watching certain members of the pro-ASL deaf world try to speak on complex political or societal issues. Their worldview is shaped by an insular culture, often cut off from broader conversations happening in the rest of society. So when they step onto a national or even regional public stage to speak on topics like free speech, hate groups, or political dynamics—they don’t realize how limited their framework is. They just don’t know what they don’t know.\\n\\nTim Gough is a prime example of this. But Elvis Zornoza, in this case, might be an even clearer one.\\n\\nThis analogy also resonates deeply with me. I grew up in a mainstream environment. I have one foot in the deaf world, and the other firmly planted in the larger world. So when I see people speaking confidently from inside the fishbowl, I can’t help but feel frustrated—and sometimes even embarrassed.\\n\\n#Conclusion\\n\\nI think this entire post speaks for itself. So I want to close with a piece of advice for all deaf college students.\\n\\nCharlie Kirk will visit your campus. You will be tempted to show up to his event. And you might feel like you can go up to the mic and speak your truth.\\n\\nPlease understand this: that’s exactly what he wants.\\n\\nCharlie Kirk’s entire schtick is built around baiting left-leaning students into confronting him on stage. He films it, spins it, and posts it on social media to generate rage-clicks and ridicule from his audience. That’s the game.\\n\\nIf you find yourself at his mic—you’ve already lost. Not because your values are wrong (they’re not), but because Charlie Kirk is absurdly well-prepared. He has a scripted answer ready for every progressive talking point. He will tear you apart, not because he’s right, but because it’s his arena. And once the clip hits his socials, you become content—fodder for right-wing dopamine.\\n\\nLogan Evans fell into this trap. Yes, we’re sympathetic to him. Yes, we cheer the absurd poetry of him giving Charlie Kirk the “Cock Penis” name sign.\\n\\nBut let this be a lesson.\\n\\nDon’t let Charlie Kirk use you. Don’t let him spin your voice into viral content for people who don’t care about our community or our dignity.\\n\\nBe smarter than the fishbowl.\\n\\nAnd with that…\\n\\n**Happy National ASL Day!**'],\n",

       "  'thread_path_text': ['PLEASE Avoid Learning ASL from JB Mitchell, Michelle Wierman and ASL With Lola\\nI want to address a significant issue that\\'s been troubling for many of us committed to authentic ASL learning. **JB Mitchell**, a somewhat known figure in the ASL education space, particularly on TikTok([@\\\\_this\\\\_real\\\\_jb](https://www.tiktok.com/@_this_real_jb)). Despite his claims of holding advanced degrees, his actual academic background—a BS in an unrelated field—does not support these claims. His teaching might seem convenient, but they perpetuate harmful myths, such as equating ASL with English, and blurring the lines between PSE (Pidgin Signed English) and SEE (Signed Exact English) with ASL. These misconceptions not only confuse new learners but also disrespect the ASL community.\\n\\nAdditionally, JB\\'s teachings dismiss decades of rigorous linguistic research. Brilliant linguists have spent years establishing ASL as a linguistically rich, fully functional language with its own syntax and grammar, separate from English. Key studies, such as those presented by Valli &amp; Lucas in \"Linguistics of American Sign Language\" and Clayton Valli\\'s work on ASL poetry, illustrate the unique morphological and syntactic structures of ASL that differ fundamentally from spoken English. Moreover, research by scholars like Stokoe in the 1960s, who first recognized ASL as a true language with its own grammar and syntax, fundamentally challenges the notion that ASL is merely a gestural representation of English. To equate ASL with English, even indirectly, undermines this extensive body of work and spreads misinformation, contributing to the erosion of the very foundation on which ASL stands as a distinct and autonomous language. This not only disrespects the linguistic integrity of ASL but also diminishes the cultural identity of the Deaf community.\\n\\nFurthermore, JB misleadingly claims authorship of a book, but it was actually his sister, Julia B. Mitchell, who wrote\\xa0[*His\\xa0Silent World*](https://a.co/d/i2dhjBF). He also uses platforms like\\xa0[GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/)\\xa0to solicit funds under questionable pretenses.\\n\\nHis defensive tactics include attempts to dismiss professional ASL instructors like Jason Gervase from ASL Pinnacle, a college-level ASL professor, for disagreeing with him. JB has even gone so far as to repeatedly contact Jason’s place of employment with false information in an attempt to get him fired. These actions, including inappropriate accusations of racism toward critics from the Deaf community, are particularly alarming.\\n\\nCaution is also advised regarding resources like **Michelle Wierman** from\\xa0[Learn\\xa0ASL\\xa0with\\xa0Michelle](https://www.instagram.com/learn_asl_with_michelle/)\\xa0or [Stellar ASL](http://stellarasl.com). Despite her high visibility on platforms like\\xa0[TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@learn_asl_with_michelle)\\xa0and Instagram, Michelle, who is hearing, has been noted for teaching incorrect signs, blocking Deaf people who critique her, and prioritizing profit over genuine engagement with Deaf culture. Her large following unfortunately detracts from more qualified and authentic Deaf educators.\\n\\nAnother concerning case is that of **ASL with Lola**, found on Instagram at\\xa0[ASL\\xa0with\\xa0Lola](https://www.instagram.com/asl_with_lola/), also with a large following. Lola has been notoriously teaching inaccurate ASL for years and has even falsified her qualifications, going so far as to pose as a certified interpreter and interpreting the national anthem at the University of Alabama. Such deceptive practices are not only unethical but also harmful to the integrity of ASL communication and the Deaf community\\'s trust in interpreters. Before any objections arise about critiquing a young person, please note that Lola is now at least 18 years old and legally an adult.\\n\\nFor those looking to learn ASL through respectful and authentic channels, consider following and learning from qualified Deaf instructors and creators. Here is an organized list of some excellent educators and creators, but please note that ***this list is not exhaustive***:\\n\\n**Educators**\\n\\n* Ashley Clark (signedwithheart)\\n* Bill Vicars (lifeprint.com)\\n* Jason Gervase (ASL Pinnacle)\\n* Loni Friedmann (loni.friedmann)\\n* Sara Miller (adventuresindeafed)\\n* Stephanie Zamorza (The ASL Shop)\\n* Suzy (aslsuzyq)\\n* Tammy Carpenter (One Fact ASL)\\n\\n**Creators and Influencers**\\n\\n* Amelia Hensley\\n* The Ariel Series (Maya and Spencer)\\n* Arlene Ngalle\\n* Blake Culley\\n* Brett Shaffer\\n* Carlisle Robinson\\n* Christine Sun Kim\\n* Dack Virnig\\n* Daniel Beool (cookingwithdanielb)\\n* Daniel Durant\\n* David &amp; Bri (signsofgoodfood)\\n* Deafies in Drag\\n* Denton Mallas\\n* Dickie Hearts\\n* Elizabeth Harris\\n* Estefani Arevalo\\n* Gabriel J. Silva\\n* Hannah Fish (deaf.that)\\n* Jacob Covell\\n* Jacelyn Fincher\\n* Jason Hoang\\n* John McGinty\\n* Josh Castille\\n* Kody Dixon (kodydixon88)\\n* Leila Hanaumi (todayiawaken)\\n* Mary Harman Whited\\n* Matthew Maxey (Deafinitely Dope)\\n* Melissa Yingst (melmira)\\n* Nakia Charmay Smith\\n* Nyle Di Marco\\n* Phelan Conheady\\n* Rachel Burton (suchalovelyred)\\n* Raven Sutton (bluejay19xx)\\n* Renca Dunn (reallyrenca)\\n* Rikki Poynter\\n* Rocco Bauer\\n* Rogan Shannon\\n* Rosa Lee\\n* Russell Harvard\\n* Sara Novic\\n* Savannah Dahan\\n* Shaylee Mansfield\\n* Sheena Lyles\\n* TJ and Kylee (tjandkylee)\\n* Why I Sign\\n\\nFor those seeking to learn ASL through respectful and authentic channels, I encourage you to explore and learn from the following qualified Deaf instructors and creators. They truly represent and uplift the Deaf community with their accurate and respectful use of ASL. Supporting and learning from these experts ensures a meaningful connection to ASL, helping to preserve and celebrate Deaf culture and its language.'],\n",

If you upload a video for immediate publishing, it may take anywhere from a few minutes to a couple of days for YouTube to get around to producing the auto captions. Larger channels with larger viewer numbers are prioritised for the server work to produce them, I believe.

      "I mean no disrespect, I am hearing and learning sign language. I am genuinely confused. I have been seeing commercials and movies coming out with a sign language interpreter in the bottom corner. I am wondering why this is a thing. I feel like it would be to overly distracting from the content, and subtitles would be the better option bc it doesn't take up as much sypace. Do people find this more helpful or preferable than subtitles. And if so why?.

I am not leanring sign be an interpreter, I am learning because I am interested in the culture, and I want to be able to communicate with the deaf community. I like that you guys were able to help me understand why thus would be helpful compared to subtitles. I know sign language has a different word order in sentences so that totally makes sense why the video visual would be helpful. I also did not think about rare circumstances or children reading. But that makes total sense. Again I'm sorry if I offended anyone the internet is hard to express your actual tone. My learning asl is coming from a good place, not for clout, teaching, or interpreting. I think asl is beautiful and I try to do my learning in the most respectful way so please do not misinterpret my oringial post. Thank you all who took the time to explain this to me. ❤️🤟\n",

But BSL interpretation is a must for culturally Deaf people - while most of us can understand written English to an extent it's a second language and not nearly as accessible as having an interpreter, and some people can't use it at all. Captions don't make BSL interpretation unnecessary - BSL is a different language with its own grammar etc not an accessibility adjustment. If there's a budget restriction/other need to cut down on interpreters use a recorded BSL interpretation for the film and a live interpreter for the spoken bits that change rather than replacing the film interpretation with just captions. If possible do both, if not it really depends on your audience - if you get (or are trying to attract) a lot of culturally Deaf people prioritize BSL interpreters, otherwise prioritize captioning.\n",
