We (the network) would like to create a show in which the deaf community is our first priority. We will have the characters use American sign language to communicate. However, I'd also like to know what you (the deaf community) feel is missing in television when it comes to making your experience more enjoyable while consuming content. Please let me know what you would like to see more of in television! The more details, the better. </author: underthemoonlight08>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: Distracted-by-Shiny toEvalutate=true/>\n    Accurate captions - the absolute #1 thing\n\nMaybe show how hearing people can communicate with deaf by using phone apps\n\nMaybe show the pros and cons of interactions with and without hearing aids\n\nIf it\u2019s America, you can show how awful our medical system, employment, & disability is for deaf people. \n\nMaybe show a combination of hearing and deaf people. Deaf people are part of the world.\n\nMy first thought about a Sci Fi deaf show is how scary being in the dark is if you can\u2019t hear.\n\nIt sucks to be in the dark. I try not to go out at night.\n\nMy son likes to sneak up and scare me for fun after I go to bed. It\u2019s kinda a fun game we play. I can\u2019t hear him sneaking in the dark but I look for visual cues. He\u2019s gotten me real good a couple of times.\n\nI\u2019m an easy scare at haunted houses.\n\nOn the plus side, I have excellent visual memory and can tell you if something has moved or where it was last seen. It\u2019s like detective show accurate. If it\u2019s moved an inch, I\u2019ve noticed.\n   </ author: Distracted-by-Shiny/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

It\u2019s a much better film and they actually do a decent job of representing sign language and one person\u2019s experience of being Deaf. It\u2019s also jus a good movie. \nIn general, be wary of using commercial films as a sign language teacher. They\u2019re not always as accurate as they should be and as people want them to be.

We (the network) would like to create a show in which the deaf community is our first priority. We will have the characters use American sign language to communicate. However, I'd also like to know what you (the deaf community) feel is missing in television when it comes to making your experience more enjoyable while consuming content. Please let me know what you would like to see more of in television! The more details, the better. </author: underthemoonlight08>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: Distracted-by-Shiny toEvalutate=true/>\n    Accurate captions - the absolute #1 thing\n\nMaybe show how hearing people can communicate with deaf by using phone apps\n\nMaybe show the pros and cons of interactions with and without hearing aids\n\nIf it\u2019s America, you can show how awful our medical system, employment, & disability is for deaf people. \n\nMaybe show a combination of hearing and deaf people. Deaf people are part of the world.\n\nMy first thought about a Sci Fi deaf show is how scary being in the dark is if you can\u2019t hear.\n\nIt sucks to be in the dark. I try not to go out at night.\n\nMy son likes to sneak up and scare me for fun after I go to bed. It\u2019s kinda a fun game we play. I can\u2019t hear him sneaking in the dark but I look for visual cues. He\u2019s gotten me real good a couple of times.\n\nI\u2019m an easy scare at haunted houses.\n\nOn the plus side, I have excellent visual memory and can tell you if something has moved or where it was last seen. It\u2019s like detective show accurate. If it\u2019s moved an inch, I\u2019ve noticed.\n   </ author: Distracted-by-Shiny/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

It\u2019s a much better film and they actually do a decent job of representing sign language and one person\u2019s experience of being Deaf. It\u2019s also jus a good movie. \nIn general, be wary of using commercial films as a sign language teacher. They\u2019re not always as accurate as they should be and as people want them to be.

We (the network) would like to create a show in which the deaf community is our first priority. We will have the characters use American sign language to communicate. However, I'd also like to know what you (the deaf community) feel is missing in television when it comes to making your experience more enjoyable while consuming content. Please let me know what you would like to see more of in television! The more details, the better. </author: underthemoonlight08>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: Distracted-by-Shiny toEvalutate=true/>\n    Accurate captions - the absolute #1 thing\n\nMaybe show how hearing people can communicate with deaf by using phone apps\n\nMaybe show the pros and cons of interactions with and without hearing aids\n\nIf it\u2019s America, you can show how awful our medical system, employment, & disability is for deaf people. \n\nMaybe show a combination of hearing and deaf people.

He\u2019s gotten me real good a couple of times.\n\nI\u2019m an easy scare at haunted houses.\n\nOn the plus side, I have excellent visual memory and can tell you if something has moved or where it was last seen.

We (the network) would like to create a show in which the deaf community is our first priority. We will have the characters use American sign language to communicate. However, I'd also like to know what you (the deaf community) feel is missing in television when it comes to making your experience more enjoyable while consuming content. Please let me know what you would like to see more of in television! The more details, the better. </author: underthemoonlight08>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: Distracted-by-Shiny toEvalutate=true/>\n    Accurate captions - the absolute #1 thing\n\nMaybe show how hearing people can communicate with deaf by using phone apps\n\nMaybe show the pros and cons of interactions with and without hearing aids\n\nIf it\u2019s America, you can show how awful our medical system, employment, & disability is for deaf people. \n\nMaybe show a combination of hearing and deaf people. Deaf people are part of the world.\n\nMy first thought about a Sci Fi deaf show is how scary being in the dark is if you can\u2019t hear.\n\nIt sucks to be in the dark. I try not to go out at night.\n\nMy son likes to sneak up and scare me for fun after I go to bed. It\u2019s kinda a fun game we play. I can\u2019t hear him sneaking in the dark but I look for visual cues. He\u2019s gotten me real good a couple of times.\n\nI\u2019m an easy scare at haunted houses.\n\nOn the plus side, I have excellent visual memory and can tell you if something has moved or where it was last seen. It\u2019s like detective show accurate. If it\u2019s moved an inch, I\u2019ve noticed.\n   </ author: Distracted-by-Shiny/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

It also bugs me when people shrug off closed captions, which makes me anxious and nervous the next time to ask. \n\nPhone calls bug me. I prefer texting and video call over phone calls. We're lucky to have that these days. \n\nI'm tired of being told \"I'll tell you later\" because I know you'll forget. Just tell me now!\n\nCar radios that are too quiet...\nMasks...\nPeople that won't speak up...\nPeople that whisper in a mask...\nKnowing that wind and bugs make noise or that people can hear the toilet flush from a few rooms away...\n\nNot only do people not believe me that I can't hear in my left ear but most don't take me seriously when I say I can't see at night. \n\nWhy can't any of these \"disabilities\" be talked about? </author: Icy-Coffee-7452>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: catpiss_backpack toEvalutate=true/>\n    I am Deaf/HOH bilingual bicultural but of course, hearing people won\u2019t understand what that even means. I hate wearing my hearing aids and would prefer to just not. But it\u2019s hard to enforce my boundaries with hearing people who have never had to think about the way they communicate before. They\u2019re just used to mumbling to each other across the room and can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like not being able to hear it. And then you feel disheartened and tired asking repeatedly. And wondering how much information you miss all the time because they might be calling something out from over there. So frustrating. It\u2019s a change of point of view for them but you can\u2019t really force someone to examine that like\u2026 at work\n   </ author: catpiss_backpack/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

I work for a big box retail store. In our break room we have a television. I don't have a smartphone, but everyone else does, so I am typically the only one watching the TV.\n\nI always turn on Closed Captioning so I can understand what's going on, especially since there is a lot  of other noise \\(people talking, watching videos on their phones without headphones, loud box fans because it's hot\\).\n\nThere is an individual, who I'm going to call \"John,\" who hates Closed Captioning for some reason.\n\nI never turn off CC when my break is over. Other people I work with have told me that they prefer it on because some of them also have hearing problems \\(but don't identify as Hard of Hearing\\), or they sit far away from the TV and can't hear it from where they are, or just because it helps them focus on what's happening. However, none of these people turn on the CC themselves, the just prefer it when it's already on, so I am the only one who switches it on.\n\nA few weeks ago I was on one of my breaks watching TV with CC when John walks up to me and says very firmly, \"Hey Carly, you need to turn the captions off when you're done.\"\n\nMe: \"Why?\"\n\nJohn: \"You're the only person in this store who has problems with their ears, so you need to turn the captions off.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not the only one who is Hard of Hearing in this store, there are other people who needs captions.\" \\(\\(At this time there were two other people who also identified as Hard of Hearing\\)\\)\n\nJohn: \"Oh yeah, who?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not outing people's medical conditions to you.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn the captions off.\"\n\nIt was a very odd interaction.\n\nSomething similar happened the next week, but this time I was sitting with two other people, and the entire time John was telling me that I need to turn off the captions, the other two were telling him that they wanted the captions on, but he absolutely didn't listen to them.\n\nLast week I was clocked out for lunch so I decided to do some shopping. John saw me and called my name, then marched right up to me and very aggressively said \"You **need** to turn the captions off when you're done in the break room.\"\n\nMe: \"That's very [ableist](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism) of you to say, John.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn off the captions.\"\n\nMe: \"John, I'm shopping right now.\"\n\nThen I turned around and walked off to finish getting groceries.\n\nWhen I clocked in this past Monday, I immediately went to HR and told them that I was being intimidated by a coworker because of my disability. They said that they would follow up. I believe they left before they were able to talk to him.\n\nAt my store we announce when we are going to break over our radios so that people know if they need to watch that area. After I announced that I was going on lunch, I went to the break room and saw John's stuff sitting across from where I usually sit \\(by the TV so I can hear better\\), and immediately sat farther away near a coworker.\n\nShe told me that just before I got there John was ranting to a new coworker of ours that I always turn on the captions but that he wasn't going to let me, so he was going to hide the remote.\n\nI looked around and noticed that the remote was indeed missing. I was furious, so I got up to go talk to his immediate supervisor because this is absolutely ridiculous. I passed by John, who was putting something in his locker, and he sneered at me, saying, \"Looking for something, Carly?\"\n\nI didn't respond, but just walked past him and talked to his supervisor, who said he would talk to him. I also told my boss, and wrote down an account of what happened to give to HR.\n\nWhen I went back in to the break room I sat by my coworker again, and was talking with her. John kept trying to make conversation but I purposefully didn't look at him so I couldn't read his lips, but I was able to hear him say \"What, can she not hear me or something?\"\n\nHe sounded genuinely surprised that the Hard of Hearing girl who needs Closed Captioning might not be able to hear him, and even more surprised that I didn't want to talk to him after he purposefully hid the remote from me.\n\nLiterally Closed Captioning is just such an odd thing to be so violently opposed to, and he is probably the most \"Think Hearing\" person I've ever had the displeasure to work with. It's almost impressive how clueless he is.\n\nI had yesterday off, but will be working tonight. I'm curious what HR has to say, if they are there this evening.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I am honestly just astonished by this aggressive behavior.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot to tell you guys the best part of this entire situation! He doesn't even *watch* the TV most of the time. I've seen him turn off the CC or change the channel \\(without asking anyone else in the break room, he'll just grab the remote and change it\\), and then he will sit with his back to the TV and watch videos on his phone with the volume all the way up. He did this once when a *commercial* for American Idol came on, just grabbed the remote and changed the channel. I asked him why he changed the channel without asking and he just said \"I hate American Idol,\" and then turned around and watched videos on his phone, so I don't know what his deal is.  \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/8llwj8/workplace_bully_wont_let_me_have_cc/dzhlae0/) </author: Carlyndra>\n<author: Carlyndra indent=1> Update: I just got home from work.  \n\nI talked to HR again, and they said they were going to talk to John. John is now no longer allowed to speak to me in any capacity, and if I'm able to I'm allowed to try to take my breaks at different times than him.  \n\nI pushed my HR for more info, and they said they are partnering with the person one step above them, but if John doesn't say or do anything else, then this is the end of it, and they aren't going to pursue any further corrective action.   </author: Carlyndra>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: pilotavery toEvalutate=true/>\n    From what you've explained, I don't think he's going to last very long.\n   </ author: pilotavery/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

I work for a big box retail store. In our break room we have a television. I don't have a smartphone, but everyone else does, so I am typically the only one watching the TV.\n\nI always turn on Closed Captioning so I can understand what's going on, especially since there is a lot  of other noise \\(people talking, watching videos on their phones without headphones, loud box fans because it's hot\\).\n\nThere is an individual, who I'm going to call \"John,\" who hates Closed Captioning for some reason.\n\nI never turn off CC when my break is over. Other people I work with have told me that they prefer it on because some of them also have hearing problems \\(but don't identify as Hard of Hearing\\), or they sit far away from the TV and can't hear it from where they are, or just because it helps them focus on what's happening. However, none of these people turn on the CC themselves, the just prefer it when it's already on, so I am the only one who switches it on.\n\nA few weeks ago I was on one of my breaks watching TV with CC when John walks up to me and says very firmly, \"Hey Carly, you need to turn the captions off when you're done.\"\n\nMe: \"Why?\"\n\nJohn: \"You're the only person in this store who has problems with their ears, so you need to turn the captions off.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not the only one who is Hard of Hearing in this store, there are other people who needs captions.\" \\(\\(At this time there were two other people who also identified as Hard of Hearing\\)\\)\n\nJohn: \"Oh yeah, who?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not outing people's medical conditions to you.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn the captions off.\"\n\nIt was a very odd interaction.\n\nSomething similar happened the next week, but this time I was sitting with two other people, and the entire time John was telling me that I need to turn off the captions, the other two were telling him that they wanted the captions on, but he absolutely didn't listen to them.\n\nLast week I was clocked out for lunch so I decided to do some shopping. John saw me and called my name, then marched right up to me and very aggressively said \"You **need** to turn the captions off when you're done in the break room.\"\n\nMe: \"That's very [ableist](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism) of you to say, John.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn off the captions.\"\n\nMe: \"John, I'm shopping right now.\"\n\nThen I turned around and walked off to finish getting groceries.\n\nWhen I clocked in this past Monday, I immediately went to HR and told them that I was being intimidated by a coworker because of my disability. They said that they would follow up. I believe they left before they were able to talk to him.\n\nAt my store we announce when we are going to break over our radios so that people know if they need to watch that area. After I announced that I was going on lunch, I went to the break room and saw John's stuff sitting across from where I usually sit \\(by the TV so I can hear better\\), and immediately sat farther away near a coworker.\n\nShe told me that just before I got there John was ranting to a new coworker of ours that I always turn on the captions but that he wasn't going to let me, so he was going to hide the remote.\n\nI looked around and noticed that the remote was indeed missing. I was furious, so I got up to go talk to his immediate supervisor because this is absolutely ridiculous. I passed by John, who was putting something in his locker, and he sneered at me, saying, \"Looking for something, Carly?\"\n\nI didn't respond, but just walked past him and talked to his supervisor, who said he would talk to him. I also told my boss, and wrote down an account of what happened to give to HR.\n\nWhen I went back in to the break room I sat by my coworker again, and was talking with her. John kept trying to make conversation but I purposefully didn't look at him so I couldn't read his lips, but I was able to hear him say \"What, can she not hear me or something?\"\n\nHe sounded genuinely surprised that the Hard of Hearing girl who needs Closed Captioning might not be able to hear him, and even more surprised that I didn't want to talk to him after he purposefully hid the remote from me.\n\nLiterally Closed Captioning is just such an odd thing to be so violently opposed to, and he is probably the most \"Think Hearing\" person I've ever had the displeasure to work with. It's almost impressive how clueless he is.\n\nI had yesterday off, but will be working tonight. I'm curious what HR has to say, if they are there this evening.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I am honestly just astonished by this aggressive behavior.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot to tell you guys the best part of this entire situation!

I was trying to ask if they specifically want open captions only or if something like rear window captioning might be an acceptable alternative but they blocked me before I finished writing the question. \n\nI framed the question by explaining that on-screen captions plus camera movement can trigger my motion sickness, bc I was trying to Illustrate that open captions on all movies always might be more than a preference issue for some ppl, but they might have just assumed I was being stupid or argumentative or trolling. Which is fine. I am indeed stupid a lot and no one has to read my thoughts or answer my questions. \n\nBut I'm more concerned that there's maybe something about my question that was legitimately offensive. I tried googling it, but the only thing seems to be that rear window is prohibitively expensive so maybe that's not accessible if it can't be available equally? Or is open captioning preferred by the Deaf community bc it's very visible and automatic rather than just being an option ppl have to specifically seek out or try to find? Or some other reason? \n\nI genuinely want to learn people's opinions and perspectives. Im totally not passionate about rear window captioning or even movies and television at all. I'm not invested in the answer either way, but I do want to avoid being unintentionally hurtful or dismissive in the future and learn more about the topic in general. </author: iamasecretthrowaway>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: surdophobe toEvalutate=true/>\n    OK first of all rear-window captioning was a film-only thing. It went away about 11 years ago in the digital conversion. So please consider that in your search you are looking at very old data and very old arguments and obsolete restrictions against that data. \n\nBack then the only way for an open captioned movie to exist was to take a physical copy of the movie and use a laser to permanently etch the captions onto the film.  But now, every single theater and every single copy of the movie can be viewed with open captions. It just a matter of the projector operators loading into their equipment that way.  \n\n>I framed the question by explaining that on-screen captions plus camera movement can trigger my motion sickness,\n\nThat's quite a dubious claim, to be honest. I too would assume you were making shit up to be argumentive. \n\n>But I'm more concerned that there's maybe something about my question that was legitimately offensive.\n\nYou are extremely ill-informed about how bad the problem has been for the last 10+ years.  The tech that replaced rear-window captioning has been abysmal. There's no longer the excuse of scarcity or expense from the movie theaters. \n\n>Im totally not passionate about rear window captioning\n\nI find this to be doubtful as well, you keep using terminology for tech that has not existed for over a decade.  If you were passionate at all you would have read up on the history of this issue and hopefully have realized how little you currently know about all this.\n   </ author: surdophobe/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

I was trying to ask if they specifically want open captions only or if something like rear window captioning might be an acceptable alternative but they blocked me before I finished writing the question. \n\nI framed the question by explaining that on-screen captions plus camera movement can trigger my motion sickness, bc I was trying to Illustrate that open captions on all movies always might be more than a preference issue for some ppl, but they might have just assumed I was being stupid or argumentative or trolling. Which is fine. I am indeed stupid a lot and no one has to read my thoughts or answer my questions. \n\nBut I'm more concerned that there's maybe something about my question that was legitimately offensive. I tried googling it, but the only thing seems to be that rear window is prohibitively expensive so maybe that's not accessible if it can't be available equally? Or is open captioning preferred by the Deaf community bc it's very visible and automatic rather than just being an option ppl have to specifically seek out or try to find? Or some other reason? \n\nI genuinely want to learn people's opinions and perspectives. Im totally not passionate about rear window captioning or even movies and television at all.

Recently, she did a round of interviews with right-wing media outlets, where she communicated in ASL with interpreters.\n\nHere are couple of interviews:\n\n[BlazeTV Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNSzVw_GX5c)\n\n[The Daily Moth's coverage with another interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bZPlgJ2q-4)\n\nThis caught the attention of the notorious deaf vlogger, Ricky Taylor. \n\nHe spoke about this with some people in the deaf community and someone recognized her. That someone told him her real name. \n\nRicky made a Threads post where he named DataRepublican\u2019s real identity\u2014Jennica Pounds\u2014which set off a firestorm on social media. Jennica responded with the following Twitter post:\n\n>I have been doxxed. Rather than let others control the narrative, I am addressing this directly.\n\n>My name is Jennica Pounds. I recently resigned from my job to pursue DOGE-adjacent efforts full-time. While my background check is still in progress, my ultimate goal is to work with the Administration to cut waste and improve efficiency.\n\n>What began as a side hobby became a mission when I uncovered the role of NGOs in these issues. This is not about left or right. This is about us\u2014the people.\n\n>I gave up everything for this\u2014my safety, my career\u2014because I believe in what I am doing.\n\n>I am 100% Deaf and nonverbal. My lack of signing fluency does not make me any less Deaf. It is a result of a language impairment related to my autism called expressive dysphasia, which affects my ability to construct language fluently in real-time. This impacts my signing, speaking, and even writing, though writing allows me more time to correct mistakes. My interpreter and I spend hours refining my talking points to ensure she conveys what I mean, not just what I say.\n\n>I am Deaf. And being Deaf is not, and should never be, defined by one\u2019s signing ability, particularly when there are medical conditions involved.\n\n>I do not believe the Deaf community should be politically aligned with any party. A priority of mine has always been holding the Administration accountable to Deaf Americans, including advocating for policy changes such as allowing a second interpreter camera stream on television broadcasts. I will continue using my platform to push for these necessary changes.\u201d\n\nHer post triggered a wave of MAGA supporters (mostly hearing people) who brigaded Ricky Taylor\u2019s latest vlog about USAID, posting his home address, descriptions of his house and car, and threats against him\u2014literally doxxing him.\n\nRicky responded in a hilariously defiant way, mocking them. \n\nThen, lo and behold, [Rolling Stone published an article about Jennica Pounds](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/elon-musk-data-republican-anonymous-data-expert-doge-tech-1235280817/). The article referenced a \u201cdeaf man\u201d who named her\u2014obviously referring to Ricky.\n\nThe Rolling Stone article was brutal in its criticism of Jennica\u2019s role in spreading misinformation, which has been used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling key government functions. It also revealed details about her husband, home, distillery business, employment history, and a company she registered in Utah. Basically, it was a takedown piece.\n\nFYI - I heard Rolling Stone had been working on this article for a while, intending to be the first to expose Jennica\u2019s identity\u2014but Ricky beat them to it. That led to Rolling Stone reaching out to Ricky before publication, hence the vague reference to a \u201cdeaf man\u201d who named her.\n\nAlso the timing of this post is really perfect because today [The New York Times published a full list of DOGE staffers](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/27/us/politics/doge-staff-list.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare). \n\nMAGA supporters are now crying about doxxing\u2014the same way they did when Ricky exposed Jennica. But there\u2019s plenty of online discussion about how these people are on the government payroll, impacting American citizens, meaning their identities should be public.\n\n#My Take on This Drama\n\n***My Sympathy for Jennica***\n\nFirst, I want to address the backlash Jennica faced over her ASL skills. Many in the deaf community mocked her signing in the interview videos and even questioned whether she was actually deaf.\n\nIf you know me, you know I despise when people\u2014usually \u201cD\u201d Deaf community members\u2014judge deaf people with below-average ASL skills as \u2018not real Deaf.\u2019\n\nJennica explained that she is a nonverbal autistic deaf person. I\u2019ve met nonverbal autistic deaf people before, and I value them as part of our community. Just because her ASL isn\u2019t fluent or native doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not deaf. I see Jennica as one of us.\n\n#However\u2026\n\nThat said, I have zero sympathy for her role as a data/software engineer being used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling critical government functions that serve and protect disabled people\u2014all of us here.\n\nJennica claims Ricky doxxed her. That\u2019s bullshit. \n\nShe did public interviews showing her face. Yes, she wore sunglasses, but let\u2019s be real\u2014sunglasses aren\u2019t a disguise.\n\nShe was already newsworthy in the deaf community for being a deaf data/software engineer praised by Elon Musk and Charlie Kirk. She boasted about their praise on her website. She also made it publicly known she was joining DOGE.\n\nIt was inevitable that deaf people would start talking and someone would recognize her. Our community is too small for it not to happen.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Rolling Stone\u2019s article. Her endeavors with \"DataRepublicans\" were public enough to attract the attention from a major publication company. They went way deeper in exposing her background. Their criticism of Jennica was completely valid. That article was coming out regardless of Ricky's post. \n\nBy choosing to align herself with this effort, Jennica should have expected public scrutiny.\n\n#In Conclusion\u2026\n\nRicky did nothing wrong by naming her. It was going to happen anyway.\n\nAnd it\u2019s beyond hypocritical for right-wingers to accuse him of doxxing when they literally doxxed Ricky.\n\nSo here we are\u2014a deaf person in our community has aligned herself with an administration that is actively working against us. </author: HelensScarletFever>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: killerbrain toEvalutate=true/>\n    You said it well. It's extremely sad and pathetic that Jennica is assisting the same people working to destroy all the services she benefited from. She should not be attacked for her signing skills.

Recently, she did a round of interviews with right-wing media outlets, where she communicated in ASL with interpreters.\n\nHere are couple of interviews:\n\n[BlazeTV Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNSzVw_GX5c)\n\n[The Daily Moth's coverage with another interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bZPlgJ2q-4)\n\nThis caught the attention of the notorious deaf vlogger, Ricky Taylor. \n\nHe spoke about this with some people in the deaf community and someone recognized her. That someone told him her real name. \n\nRicky made a Threads post where he named DataRepublican\u2019s real identity\u2014Jennica Pounds\u2014which set off a firestorm on social media. Jennica responded with the following Twitter post:\n\n>I have been doxxed. Rather than let others control the narrative, I am addressing this directly.\n\n>My name is Jennica Pounds. I recently resigned from my job to pursue DOGE-adjacent efforts full-time. While my background check is still in progress, my ultimate goal is to work with the Administration to cut waste and improve efficiency.\n\n>What began as a side hobby became a mission when I uncovered the role of NGOs in these issues. This is not about left or right. This is about us\u2014the people.\n\n>I gave up everything for this\u2014my safety, my career\u2014because I believe in what I am doing.\n\n>I am 100% Deaf and nonverbal. My lack of signing fluency does not make me any less Deaf. It is a result of a language impairment related to my autism called expressive dysphasia, which affects my ability to construct language fluently in real-time. This impacts my signing, speaking, and even writing, though writing allows me more time to correct mistakes. My interpreter and I spend hours refining my talking points to ensure she conveys what I mean, not just what I say.\n\n>I am Deaf. And being Deaf is not, and should never be, defined by one\u2019s signing ability, particularly when there are medical conditions involved.\n\n>I do not believe the Deaf community should be politically aligned with any party. A priority of mine has always been holding the Administration accountable to Deaf Americans, including advocating for policy changes such as allowing a second interpreter camera stream on television broadcasts. I will continue using my platform to push for these necessary changes.\u201d\n\nHer post triggered a wave of MAGA supporters (mostly hearing people) who brigaded Ricky Taylor\u2019s latest vlog about USAID, posting his home address, descriptions of his house and car, and threats against him\u2014literally doxxing him.\n\nRicky responded in a hilariously defiant way, mocking them. \n\nThen, lo and behold, [Rolling Stone published an article about Jennica Pounds](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/elon-musk-data-republican-anonymous-data-expert-doge-tech-1235280817/). The article referenced a \u201cdeaf man\u201d who named her\u2014obviously referring to Ricky.\n\nThe Rolling Stone article was brutal in its criticism of Jennica\u2019s role in spreading misinformation, which has been used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling key government functions. It also revealed details about her husband, home, distillery business, employment history, and a company she registered in Utah. Basically, it was a takedown piece.\n\nFYI - I heard Rolling Stone had been working on this article for a while, intending to be the first to expose Jennica\u2019s identity\u2014but Ricky beat them to it. That led to Rolling Stone reaching out to Ricky before publication, hence the vague reference to a \u201cdeaf man\u201d who named her.\n\nAlso the timing of this post is really perfect because today [The New York Times published a full list of DOGE staffers](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/27/us/politics/doge-staff-list.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare). \n\nMAGA supporters are now crying about doxxing\u2014the same way they did when Ricky exposed Jennica. But there\u2019s plenty of online discussion about how these people are on the government payroll, impacting American citizens, meaning their identities should be public.\n\n#My Take on This Drama\n\n***My Sympathy for Jennica***\n\nFirst, I want to address the backlash Jennica faced over her ASL skills. Many in the deaf community mocked her signing in the interview videos and even questioned whether she was actually deaf.\n\nIf you know me, you know I despise when people\u2014usually \u201cD\u201d Deaf community members\u2014judge deaf people with below-average ASL skills as \u2018not real Deaf.\u2019\n\nJennica explained that she is a nonverbal autistic deaf person. I\u2019ve met nonverbal autistic deaf people before, and I value them as part of our community. Just because her ASL isn\u2019t fluent or native doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not deaf. I see Jennica as one of us.\n\n#However\u2026\n\nThat said, I have zero sympathy for her role as a data/software engineer being used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling critical government functions that serve and protect disabled people\u2014all of us here.\n\nJennica claims Ricky doxxed her. That\u2019s bullshit. \n\nShe did public interviews showing her face. Yes, she wore sunglasses, but let\u2019s be real\u2014sunglasses aren\u2019t a disguise.\n\nShe was already newsworthy in the deaf community for being a deaf data/software engineer praised by Elon Musk and Charlie Kirk. She boasted about their praise on her website. She also made it publicly known she was joining DOGE.\n\nIt was inevitable that deaf people would start talking and someone would recognize her. Our community is too small for it not to happen.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Rolling Stone\u2019s article. Her endeavors with \"DataRepublicans\" were public enough to attract the attention from a major publication company. They went way deeper in exposing her background. Their criticism of Jennica was completely valid. That article was coming out regardless of Ricky's post. \n\nBy choosing to align herself with this effort, Jennica should have expected public scrutiny.\n\n#In Conclusion\u2026\n\nRicky did nothing wrong by naming her. It was going to happen anyway.\n\nAnd it\u2019s beyond hypocritical for right-wingers to accuse him of doxxing when they literally doxxed Ricky.\n\nSo here we are\u2014a deaf person in our community has aligned herself with an administration that is actively working against us. </author: HelensScarletFever>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: killerbrain toEvalutate=true/>\n    You said it well. It's extremely sad and pathetic that Jennica is assisting the same people working to destroy all the services she benefited from. She should not be attacked for her signing skills.

I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s an app I can download for my phone. I\u2019m going to the movies next week. I don\u2019t go often and I really don\u2019t want to have to ask for the closed caption device. TIA!  </author: alittlefaith530>\n<author: Kuildeous indent=1> Why not the closed caption device? Is it the fear of battery power? I had that situation with one theatre where twice the device ran out of juice. I suspect that it's negligent employees not fully charging them, but the owner said that he would investigate. Sometimes batteries go bad, so maybe he needs to replace them. \n\nI would be curious about a phone app because there's very little I can imagine that wouldn't intrude on other people's viewing pleasure, unlike the closed caption devices. \n\nAlso, caption algorithms have a long ways to go, so I would only trust professionally transcribed captions. \n\nI may check out Live Transcribe for those older movies that don't have captions loaded. </author: Kuildeous>\n<author: alittlefaith530 indent=2> That is a very good point about the phone. \n\nIt\u2019s fear of taking it away from someone who might need it more than I do. I have moderate/severe (almost profound) loss but only in one ear. I can and have managed, but for this movie I would prefer to get all of the dialog. The device would greatly help me but I wouldn\u2019t want to take it from someone who needs it more than I do. </author: alittlefaith530>\n<author: Kuildeous indent=3> That's considerate of you. From my experience, I haven't see these caption devices run out. I suppose it could be worth waiting until 5 minutes before the movie and then check in with them if they have one available. \n\nBut hearing loss is hearing loss. If you need captions to fully understand the movie, I don't think we can really say you're less deserving of this assistance than others. \n\nEspecially since movies nowadays are so freakin' loud that dialogue gets swallowed up more often than not. \n\nI've seen some theatres offer open captions for select viewings. I may have to give that a try. Still not a common occurrence, so good luck finding one of those. </author: Kuildeous>\n<author: alittlefaith530 indent=4> Thank you. That means a lot to me. Sometimes I don\u2019t feel deserving. \n\nOh yeah movies now are so hard.

I have to go rewatch the new Deadpool because the caption device *did* shut off 2/3 through. Sadly that was part of my earlier anecdote. Gonna give that theatre a pause while they gather their shit.

The problem with OIC Movies is that most of their videos are not publicly available and not all of the videos have captions. I hope there are public ASL talks in the form of TED talks with accurate translations. Any pointers on such collections of videos? </author: Zia_0216>\n<author: [deleted] indent=1> If you want TED Talks by deaf people, this playlist has a lot. Some are by signers, and some are not. I see some that seem to be by hearing people talking about deaf people (like technology for the deaf/hoh). \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA17E58E99C442771 \n\nIf those aren\u2019t to your satisfaction, let us know what else you\u2019re looking for, so we can find better videos. I also enjoy Melmira, which is a show that\u2019s more focused on human stories and lifestyles, so it\u2019s more interview-heavy, but interesting to me.

I think I\u2019ll spend a lot of time on them. I\u2019m probably asking for too much. Do you know where I can find more videos that have only one narrators / signers sitting in the center?

It\u2019s a much better film and they actually do a decent job of representing sign language and one person\u2019s experience of being Deaf. It\u2019s also jus a good movie. \nIn general, be wary of using commercial films as a sign language teacher. They\u2019re not always as accurate as they should be and as people want them to be.

It\u2019s a much better film and they actually do a decent job of representing sign language and one person\u2019s experience of being Deaf. It\u2019s also jus a good movie. \nIn general, be wary of using commercial films as a sign language teacher. They\u2019re not always as accurate as they should be and as people want them to be.

I work for a big box retail store. In our break room we have a television. I don't have a smartphone, but everyone else does, so I am typically the only one watching the TV.\n\nI always turn on Closed Captioning so I can understand what's going on, especially since there is a lot  of other noise \\(people talking, watching videos on their phones without headphones, loud box fans because it's hot\\).\n\nThere is an individual, who I'm going to call \"John,\" who hates Closed Captioning for some reason.\n\nI never turn off CC when my break is over. Other people I work with have told me that they prefer it on because some of them also have hearing problems \\(but don't identify as Hard of Hearing\\), or they sit far away from the TV and can't hear it from where they are, or just because it helps them focus on what's happening. However, none of these people turn on the CC themselves, the just prefer it when it's already on, so I am the only one who switches it on.\n\nA few weeks ago I was on one of my breaks watching TV with CC when John walks up to me and says very firmly, \"Hey Carly, you need to turn the captions off when you're done.\"\n\nMe: \"Why?\"\n\nJohn: \"You're the only person in this store who has problems with their ears, so you need to turn the captions off.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not the only one who is Hard of Hearing in this store, there are other people who needs captions.\" \\(\\(At this time there were two other people who also identified as Hard of Hearing\\)\\)\n\nJohn: \"Oh yeah, who?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not outing people's medical conditions to you.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn the captions off.\"\n\nIt was a very odd interaction.\n\nSomething similar happened the next week, but this time I was sitting with two other people, and the entire time John was telling me that I need to turn off the captions, the other two were telling him that they wanted the captions on, but he absolutely didn't listen to them.\n\nLast week I was clocked out for lunch so I decided to do some shopping. John saw me and called my name, then marched right up to me and very aggressively said \"You **need** to turn the captions off when you're done in the break room.\"\n\nMe: \"That's very [ableist](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism) of you to say, John.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn off the captions.\"\n\nMe: \"John, I'm shopping right now.\"\n\nThen I turned around and walked off to finish getting groceries.\n\nWhen I clocked in this past Monday, I immediately went to HR and told them that I was being intimidated by a coworker because of my disability. They said that they would follow up. I believe they left before they were able to talk to him.\n\nAt my store we announce when we are going to break over our radios so that people know if they need to watch that area. After I announced that I was going on lunch, I went to the break room and saw John's stuff sitting across from where I usually sit \\(by the TV so I can hear better\\), and immediately sat farther away near a coworker.\n\nShe told me that just before I got there John was ranting to a new coworker of ours that I always turn on the captions but that he wasn't going to let me, so he was going to hide the remote.\n\nI looked around and noticed that the remote was indeed missing. I was furious, so I got up to go talk to his immediate supervisor because this is absolutely ridiculous. I passed by John, who was putting something in his locker, and he sneered at me, saying, \"Looking for something, Carly?\"\n\nI didn't respond, but just walked past him and talked to his supervisor, who said he would talk to him. I also told my boss, and wrote down an account of what happened to give to HR.\n\nWhen I went back in to the break room I sat by my coworker again, and was talking with her. John kept trying to make conversation but I purposefully didn't look at him so I couldn't read his lips, but I was able to hear him say \"What, can she not hear me or something?\"\n\nHe sounded genuinely surprised that the Hard of Hearing girl who needs Closed Captioning might not be able to hear him, and even more surprised that I didn't want to talk to him after he purposefully hid the remote from me.\n\nLiterally Closed Captioning is just such an odd thing to be so violently opposed to, and he is probably the most \"Think Hearing\" person I've ever had the displeasure to work with. It's almost impressive how clueless he is.\n\nI had yesterday off, but will be working tonight. I'm curious what HR has to say, if they are there this evening.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I am honestly just astonished by this aggressive behavior.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot to tell you guys the best part of this entire situation! He doesn't even *watch* the TV most of the time.

I work for a big box retail store. In our break room we have a television. I don't have a smartphone, but everyone else does, so I am typically the only one watching the TV.\n\nI always turn on Closed Captioning so I can understand what's going on, especially since there is a lot  of other noise \\(people talking, watching videos on their phones without headphones, loud box fans because it's hot\\).\n\nThere is an individual, who I'm going to call \"John,\" who hates Closed Captioning for some reason.\n\nI never turn off CC when my break is over. Other people I work with have told me that they prefer it on because some of them also have hearing problems \\(but don't identify as Hard of Hearing\\), or they sit far away from the TV and can't hear it from where they are, or just because it helps them focus on what's happening. However, none of these people turn on the CC themselves, the just prefer it when it's already on, so I am the only one who switches it on.\n\nA few weeks ago I was on one of my breaks watching TV with CC when John walks up to me and says very firmly, \"Hey Carly, you need to turn the captions off when you're done.\"\n\nMe: \"Why?\"\n\nJohn: \"You're the only person in this store who has problems with their ears, so you need to turn the captions off.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not the only one who is Hard of Hearing in this store, there are other people who needs captions.\" \\(\\(At this time there were two other people who also identified as Hard of Hearing\\)\\)\n\nJohn: \"Oh yeah, who?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not outing people's medical conditions to you.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn the captions off.\"\n\nIt was a very odd interaction.\n\nSomething similar happened the next week, but this time I was sitting with two other people, and the entire time John was telling me that I need to turn off the captions, the other two were telling him that they wanted the captions on, but he absolutely didn't listen to them.\n\nLast week I was clocked out for lunch so I decided to do some shopping. John saw me and called my name, then marched right up to me and very aggressively said \"You **need** to turn the captions off when you're done in the break room.\"\n\nMe: \"That's very [ableist](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism) of you to say, John.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn off the captions.\"\n\nMe: \"John, I'm shopping right now.\"\n\nThen I turned around and walked off to finish getting groceries.\n\nWhen I clocked in this past Monday, I immediately went to HR and told them that I was being intimidated by a coworker because of my disability. They said that they would follow up. I believe they left before they were able to talk to him.\n\nAt my store we announce when we are going to break over our radios so that people know if they need to watch that area. After I announced that I was going on lunch, I went to the break room and saw John's stuff sitting across from where I usually sit \\(by the TV so I can hear better\\), and immediately sat farther away near a coworker.\n\nShe told me that just before I got there John was ranting to a new coworker of ours that I always turn on the captions but that he wasn't going to let me, so he was going to hide the remote.\n\nI looked around and noticed that the remote was indeed missing. I was furious, so I got up to go talk to his immediate supervisor because this is absolutely ridiculous. I passed by John, who was putting something in his locker, and he sneered at me, saying, \"Looking for something, Carly?\"\n\nI didn't respond, but just walked past him and talked to his supervisor, who said he would talk to him. I also told my boss, and wrote down an account of what happened to give to HR.\n\nWhen I went back in to the break room I sat by my coworker again, and was talking with her. John kept trying to make conversation but I purposefully didn't look at him so I couldn't read his lips, but I was able to hear him say \"What, can she not hear me or something?\"\n\nHe sounded genuinely surprised that the Hard of Hearing girl who needs Closed Captioning might not be able to hear him, and even more surprised that I didn't want to talk to him after he purposefully hid the remote from me.\n\nLiterally Closed Captioning is just such an odd thing to be so violently opposed to, and he is probably the most \"Think Hearing\" person I've ever had the displeasure to work with. It's almost impressive how clueless he is.\n\nI had yesterday off, but will be working tonight. I'm curious what HR has to say, if they are there this evening.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I am honestly just astonished by this aggressive behavior.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot to tell you guys the best part of this entire situation! He doesn't even *watch* the TV most of the time. I've seen him turn off the CC or change the channel \\(without asking anyone else in the break room, he'll just grab the remote and change it\\), and then he will sit with his back to the TV and watch videos on his phone with the volume all the way up. He did this once when a *commercial* for American Idol came on, just grabbed the remote and changed the channel. I asked him why he changed the channel without asking and he just said \"I hate American Idol,\" and then turned around and watched videos on his phone, so I don't know what his deal is.  \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/8llwj8/workplace_bully_wont_let_me_have_cc/dzhlae0/) </author: Carlyndra>\n<author: Carlyndra indent=1> Update: I just got home from work.  \n\nI talked to HR again, and they said they were going to talk to John.

I was trying to ask if they specifically want open captions only or if something like rear window captioning might be an acceptable alternative but they blocked me before I finished writing the question. \n\nI framed the question by explaining that on-screen captions plus camera movement can trigger my motion sickness, bc I was trying to Illustrate that open captions on all movies always might be more than a preference issue for some ppl, but they might have just assumed I was being stupid or argumentative or trolling. Which is fine. I am indeed stupid a lot and no one has to read my thoughts or answer my questions. \n\nBut I'm more concerned that there's maybe something about my question that was legitimately offensive. I tried googling it, but the only thing seems to be that rear window is prohibitively expensive so maybe that's not accessible if it can't be available equally? Or is open captioning preferred by the Deaf community bc it's very visible and automatic rather than just being an option ppl have to specifically seek out or try to find? Or some other reason? \n\nI genuinely want to learn people's opinions and perspectives. Im totally not passionate about rear window captioning or even movies and television at all. I'm not invested in the answer either way, but I do want to avoid being unintentionally hurtful or dismissive in the future and learn more about the topic in general. </author: iamasecretthrowaway>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: surdophobe toEvalutate=true/>\n    OK first of all rear-window captioning was a film-only thing.

Recently, she did a round of interviews with right-wing media outlets, where she communicated in ASL with interpreters.\n\nHere are couple of interviews:\n\n[BlazeTV Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNSzVw_GX5c)\n\n[The Daily Moth's coverage with another interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bZPlgJ2q-4)\n\nThis caught the attention of the notorious deaf vlogger, Ricky Taylor. \n\nHe spoke about this with some people in the deaf community and someone recognized her. That someone told him her real name. \n\nRicky made a Threads post where he named DataRepublican\u2019s real identity\u2014Jennica Pounds\u2014which set off a firestorm on social media. Jennica responded with the following Twitter post:\n\n>I have been doxxed. Rather than let others control the narrative, I am addressing this directly.\n\n>My name is Jennica Pounds. I recently resigned from my job to pursue DOGE-adjacent efforts full-time. While my background check is still in progress, my ultimate goal is to work with the Administration to cut waste and improve efficiency.\n\n>What began as a side hobby became a mission when I uncovered the role of NGOs in these issues.

I will continue using my platform to push for these necessary changes.\u201d\n\nHer post triggered a wave of MAGA supporters (mostly hearing people) who brigaded Ricky Taylor\u2019s latest vlog about USAID, posting his home address, descriptions of his house and car, and threats against him\u2014literally doxxing him.\n\nRicky responded in a hilariously defiant way, mocking them. \n\nThen, lo and behold, [Rolling Stone published an article about Jennica Pounds](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/elon-musk-data-republican-anonymous-data-expert-doge-tech-1235280817/). The article referenced a \u201cdeaf man\u201d who named her\u2014obviously referring to Ricky.\n\nThe Rolling Stone article was brutal in its criticism of Jennica\u2019s role in spreading misinformation, which has been used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling key government functions. It also revealed details about her husband, home, distillery business, employment history, and a company she registered in Utah. Basically, it was a takedown piece.\n\nFYI - I heard Rolling Stone had been working on this article for a while, intending to be the first to expose Jennica\u2019s identity\u2014but Ricky beat them to it. That led to Rolling Stone reaching out to Ricky before publication, hence the vague reference to a \u201cdeaf man\u201d who named her.\n\nAlso the timing of this post is really perfect because today [The New York Times published a full list of DOGE staffers](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/27/us/politics/doge-staff-list.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare). \n\nMAGA supporters are now crying about doxxing\u2014the same way they did when Ricky exposed Jennica. But there\u2019s plenty of online discussion about how these people are on the government payroll, impacting American citizens, meaning their identities should be public.\n\n#My Take on This Drama\n\n***My Sympathy for Jennica***\n\nFirst, I want to address the backlash Jennica faced over her ASL skills. Many in the deaf community mocked her signing in the interview videos and even questioned whether she was actually deaf.\n\nIf you know me, you know I despise when people\u2014usually \u201cD\u201d Deaf community members\u2014judge deaf people with below-average ASL skills as \u2018not real Deaf.\u2019\n\nJennica explained that she is a nonverbal autistic deaf person. I\u2019ve met nonverbal autistic deaf people before, and I value them as part of our community. Just because her ASL isn\u2019t fluent or native doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not deaf. I see Jennica as one of us.\n\n#However\u2026\n\nThat said, I have zero sympathy for her role as a data/software engineer being used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling critical government functions that serve and protect disabled people\u2014all of us here.\n\nJennica claims Ricky doxxed her. That\u2019s bullshit. \n\nShe did public interviews showing her face. Yes, she wore sunglasses, but let\u2019s be real\u2014sunglasses aren\u2019t a disguise.\n\nShe was already newsworthy in the deaf community for being a deaf data/software engineer praised by Elon Musk and Charlie Kirk. She boasted about their praise on her website. She also made it publicly known she was joining DOGE.\n\nIt was inevitable that deaf people would start talking and someone would recognize her. Our community is too small for it not to happen.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Rolling Stone\u2019s article. Her endeavors with \"DataRepublicans\" were public enough to attract the attention from a major publication company. They went way deeper in exposing her background. Their criticism of Jennica was completely valid. That article was coming out regardless of Ricky's post. \n\nBy choosing to align herself with this effort, Jennica should have expected public scrutiny.\n\n#In Conclusion\u2026\n\nRicky did nothing wrong by naming her. It was going to happen anyway.\n\nAnd it\u2019s beyond hypocritical for right-wingers to accuse him of doxxing when they literally doxxed Ricky.\n\nSo here we are\u2014a deaf person in our community has aligned herself with an administration that is actively working against us. </author: HelensScarletFever>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: killerbrain toEvalutate=true/>\n    You said it well. It's extremely sad and pathetic that Jennica is assisting the same people working to destroy all the services she benefited from. She should not be attacked for her signing skills. She SHOULD be attacked for selling her community out. She, too, will find herself as fucked as the rest of us when she's no longer useful to this group.\n   </ author: killerbrain/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

Recently, she did a round of interviews with right-wing media outlets, where she communicated in ASL with interpreters.\n\nHere are couple of interviews:\n\n[BlazeTV Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNSzVw_GX5c)\n\n[The Daily Moth's coverage with another interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bZPlgJ2q-4)\n\nThis caught the attention of the notorious deaf vlogger, Ricky Taylor. \n\nHe spoke about this with some people in the deaf community and someone recognized her. That someone told him her real name. \n\nRicky made a Threads post where he named DataRepublican\u2019s real identity\u2014Jennica Pounds\u2014which set off a firestorm on social media. Jennica responded with the following Twitter post:\n\n>I have been doxxed. Rather than let others control the narrative, I am addressing this directly.\n\n>My name is Jennica Pounds. I recently resigned from my job to pursue DOGE-adjacent efforts full-time. While my background check is still in progress, my ultimate goal is to work with the Administration to cut waste and improve efficiency.\n\n>What began as a side hobby became a mission when I uncovered the role of NGOs in these issues. This is not about left or right. This is about us\u2014the people.\n\n>I gave up everything for this\u2014my safety, my career\u2014because I believe in what I am doing.\n\n>I am 100% Deaf and nonverbal. My lack of signing fluency does not make me any less Deaf. It is a result of a language impairment related to my autism called expressive dysphasia, which affects my ability to construct language fluently in real-time. This impacts my signing, speaking, and even writing, though writing allows me more time to correct mistakes. My interpreter and I spend hours refining my talking points to ensure she conveys what I mean, not just what I say.\n\n>I am Deaf. And being Deaf is not, and should never be, defined by one\u2019s signing ability, particularly when there are medical conditions involved.\n\n>I do not believe the Deaf community should be politically aligned with any party. A priority of mine has always been holding the Administration accountable to Deaf Americans, including advocating for policy changes such as allowing a second interpreter camera stream on television broadcasts. I will continue using my platform to push for these necessary changes.\u201d\n\nHer post triggered a wave of MAGA supporters (mostly hearing people) who brigaded Ricky Taylor\u2019s latest vlog about USAID, posting his home address, descriptions of his house and car, and threats against him\u2014literally doxxing him.\n\nRicky responded in a hilariously defiant way, mocking them. \n\nThen, lo and behold, [Rolling Stone published an article about Jennica Pounds](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/elon-musk-data-republican-anonymous-data-expert-doge-tech-1235280817/). The article referenced a \u201cdeaf man\u201d who named her\u2014obviously referring to Ricky.\n\nThe Rolling Stone article was brutal in its criticism of Jennica\u2019s role in spreading misinformation, which has been used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling key government functions. It also revealed details about her husband, home, distillery business, employment history, and a company she registered in Utah. Basically, it was a takedown piece.\n\nFYI - I heard Rolling Stone had been working on this article for a while, intending to be the first to expose Jennica\u2019s identity\u2014but Ricky beat them to it. That led to Rolling Stone reaching out to Ricky before publication, hence the vague reference to a \u201cdeaf man\u201d who named her.\n\nAlso the timing of this post is really perfect because today [The New York Times published a full list of DOGE staffers](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/27/us/politics/doge-staff-list.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare). \n\nMAGA supporters are now crying about doxxing\u2014the same way they did when Ricky exposed Jennica. But there\u2019s plenty of online discussion about how these people are on the government payroll, impacting American citizens, meaning their identities should be public.\n\n#My Take on This Drama\n\n***My Sympathy for Jennica***\n\nFirst, I want to address the backlash Jennica faced over her ASL skills. Many in the deaf community mocked her signing in the interview videos and even questioned whether she was actually deaf.\n\nIf you know me, you know I despise when people\u2014usually \u201cD\u201d Deaf community members\u2014judge deaf people with below-average ASL skills as \u2018not real Deaf.\u2019\n\nJennica explained that she is a nonverbal autistic deaf person. I\u2019ve met nonverbal autistic deaf people before, and I value them as part of our community. Just because her ASL isn\u2019t fluent or native doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not deaf. I see Jennica as one of us.\n\n#However\u2026\n\nThat said, I have zero sympathy for her role as a data/software engineer being used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling critical government functions that serve and protect disabled people\u2014all of us here.\n\nJennica claims Ricky doxxed her. That\u2019s bullshit. \n\nShe did public interviews showing her face. Yes, she wore sunglasses, but let\u2019s be real\u2014sunglasses aren\u2019t a disguise.\n\nShe was already newsworthy in the deaf community for being a deaf data/software engineer praised by Elon Musk and Charlie Kirk. She boasted about their praise on her website. She also made it publicly known she was joining DOGE.\n\nIt was inevitable that deaf people would start talking and someone would recognize her. Our community is too small for it not to happen.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Rolling Stone\u2019s article. Her endeavors with \"DataRepublicans\" were public enough to attract the attention from a major publication company. They went way deeper in exposing her background. Their criticism of Jennica was completely valid. That article was coming out regardless of Ricky's post. \n\nBy choosing to align herself with this effort, Jennica should have expected public scrutiny.\n\n#In Conclusion\u2026\n\nRicky did nothing wrong by naming her. It was going to happen anyway.\n\nAnd it\u2019s beyond hypocritical for right-wingers to accuse him of doxxing when they literally doxxed Ricky.\n\nSo here we are\u2014a deaf person in our community has aligned herself with an administration that is actively working against us. </author: HelensScarletFever>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: killerbrain toEvalutate=true/>\n    You said it well. It's extremely sad and pathetic that Jennica is assisting the same people working to destroy all the services she benefited from. She should not be attacked for her signing skills. She SHOULD be attacked for selling her community out. She, too, will find herself as fucked as the rest of us when she's no longer useful to this group.\n   </ author: killerbrain/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s an app I can download for my phone. I\u2019m going to the movies next week. I don\u2019t go often and I really don\u2019t want to have to ask for the closed caption device. TIA!  </author: alittlefaith530>\n<author: Kuildeous indent=1> Why not the closed caption device? Is it the fear of battery power? I had that situation with one theatre where twice the device ran out of juice. I suspect that it's negligent employees not fully charging them, but the owner said that he would investigate. Sometimes batteries go bad, so maybe he needs to replace them. \n\nI would be curious about a phone app because there's very little I can imagine that wouldn't intrude on other people's viewing pleasure, unlike the closed caption devices. \n\nAlso, caption algorithms have a long ways to go, so I would only trust professionally transcribed captions. \n\nI may check out Live Transcribe for those older movies that don't have captions loaded. </author: Kuildeous>\n<author: alittlefaith530 indent=2> That is a very good point about the phone. \n\nIt\u2019s fear of taking it away from someone who might need it more than I do. I have moderate/severe (almost profound) loss but only in one ear. I can and have managed, but for this movie I would prefer to get all of the dialog. The device would greatly help me but I wouldn\u2019t want to take it from someone who needs it more than I do. </author: alittlefaith530>\n<author: Kuildeous indent=3> That's considerate of you. From my experience, I haven't see these caption devices run out. I suppose it could be worth waiting until 5 minutes before the movie and then check in with them if they have one available. \n\nBut hearing loss is hearing loss. If you need captions to fully understand the movie, I don't think we can really say you're less deserving of this assistance than others. \n\nEspecially since movies nowadays are so freakin' loud that dialogue gets swallowed up more often than not. \n\nI've seen some theatres offer open captions for select viewings. I may have to give that a try. Still not a common occurrence, so good luck finding one of those. </author: Kuildeous>\n<author: alittlefaith530 indent=4> Thank you. That means a lot to me. Sometimes I don\u2019t feel deserving. \n\nOh yeah movies now are so hard. I\u2019m going to see the new Deadpool and they talk to fast in those movies. </author: alittlefaith530>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: Kuildeous toEvalutate=true/>\n    Ugh.

I work for a big box retail store. In our break room we have a television. I don't have a smartphone, but everyone else does, so I am typically the only one watching the TV.\n\nI always turn on Closed Captioning so I can understand what's going on, especially since there is a lot  of other noise \\(people talking, watching videos on their phones without headphones, loud box fans because it's hot\\).\n\nThere is an individual, who I'm going to call \"John,\" who hates Closed Captioning for some reason.\n\nI never turn off CC when my break is over. Other people I work with have told me that they prefer it on because some of them also have hearing problems \\(but don't identify as Hard of Hearing\\), or they sit far away from the TV and can't hear it from where they are, or just because it helps them focus on what's happening. However, none of these people turn on the CC themselves, the just prefer it when it's already on, so I am the only one who switches it on.\n\nA few weeks ago I was on one of my breaks watching TV with CC when John walks up to me and says very firmly, \"Hey Carly, you need to turn the captions off when you're done.\"\n\nMe: \"Why?\"\n\nJohn: \"You're the only person in this store who has problems with their ears, so you need to turn the captions off.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not the only one who is Hard of Hearing in this store, there are other people who needs captions.\" \\(\\(At this time there were two other people who also identified as Hard of Hearing\\)\\)\n\nJohn: \"Oh yeah, who?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not outing people's medical conditions to you.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn the captions off.\"\n\nIt was a very odd interaction.\n\nSomething similar happened the next week, but this time I was sitting with two other people, and the entire time John was telling me that I need to turn off the captions, the other two were telling him that they wanted the captions on, but he absolutely didn't listen to them.\n\nLast week I was clocked out for lunch so I decided to do some shopping. John saw me and called my name, then marched right up to me and very aggressively said \"You **need** to turn the captions off when you're done in the break room.\"\n\nMe: \"That's very [ableist](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism) of you to say, John.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn off the captions.\"\n\nMe: \"John, I'm shopping right now.\"\n\nThen I turned around and walked off to finish getting groceries.\n\nWhen I clocked in this past Monday, I immediately went to HR and told them that I was being intimidated by a coworker because of my disability. They said that they would follow up. I believe they left before they were able to talk to him.\n\nAt my store we announce when we are going to break over our radios so that people know if they need to watch that area. After I announced that I was going on lunch, I went to the break room and saw John's stuff sitting across from where I usually sit \\(by the TV so I can hear better\\), and immediately sat farther away near a coworker.\n\nShe told me that just before I got there John was ranting to a new coworker of ours that I always turn on the captions but that he wasn't going to let me, so he was going to hide the remote.\n\nI looked around and noticed that the remote was indeed missing. I was furious, so I got up to go talk to his immediate supervisor because this is absolutely ridiculous. I passed by John, who was putting something in his locker, and he sneered at me, saying, \"Looking for something, Carly?\"\n\nI didn't respond, but just walked past him and talked to his supervisor, who said he would talk to him. I also told my boss, and wrote down an account of what happened to give to HR.\n\nWhen I went back in to the break room I sat by my coworker again, and was talking with her. John kept trying to make conversation but I purposefully didn't look at him so I couldn't read his lips, but I was able to hear him say \"What, can she not hear me or something?\"\n\nHe sounded genuinely surprised that the Hard of Hearing girl who needs Closed Captioning might not be able to hear him, and even more surprised that I didn't want to talk to him after he purposefully hid the remote from me.\n\nLiterally Closed Captioning is just such an odd thing to be so violently opposed to, and he is probably the most \"Think Hearing\" person I've ever had the displeasure to work with. It's almost impressive how clueless he is.\n\nI had yesterday off, but will be working tonight. I'm curious what HR has to say, if they are there this evening.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I am honestly just astonished by this aggressive behavior.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot to tell you guys the best part of this entire situation! He doesn't even *watch* the TV most of the time. I've seen him turn off the CC or change the channel \\(without asking anyone else in the break room, he'll just grab the remote and change it\\), and then he will sit with his back to the TV and watch videos on his phone with the volume all the way up. He did this once when a *commercial* for American Idol came on, just grabbed the remote and changed the channel. I asked him why he changed the channel without asking and he just said \"I hate American Idol,\" and then turned around and watched videos on his phone, so I don't know what his deal is.  \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/8llwj8/workplace_bully_wont_let_me_have_cc/dzhlae0/) </author: Carlyndra>\n<author: Carlyndra indent=1> Update: I just got home from work.  \n\nI talked to HR again, and they said they were going to talk to John. John is now no longer allowed to speak to me in any capacity, and if I'm able to I'm allowed to try to take my breaks at different times than him.  \n\nI pushed my HR for more info, and they said they are partnering with the person one step above them, but if John doesn't say or do anything else, then this is the end of it, and they aren't going to pursue any further corrective action.   </author: Carlyndra>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: pilotavery toEvalutate=true/>\n    From what you've explained, I don't think he's going to last very long.\n   </ author: pilotavery/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

However, none of these people turn on the CC themselves, the just prefer it when it's already on, so I am the only one who switches it on.\n\nA few weeks ago I was on one of my breaks watching TV with CC when John walks up to me and says very firmly, \"Hey Carly, you need to turn the captions off when you're done.\"\n\nMe: \"Why?\"\n\nJohn: \"You're the only person in this store who has problems with their ears, so you need to turn the captions off.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not the only one who is Hard of Hearing in this store, there are other people who needs captions.\" \\(\\(At this time there were two other people who also identified as Hard of Hearing\\)\\)\n\nJohn: \"Oh yeah, who?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not outing people's medical conditions to you.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn the captions off.\"\n\nIt was a very odd interaction.\n\nSomething similar happened the next week, but this time I was sitting with two other people, and the entire time John was telling me that I need to turn off the captions, the other two were telling him that they wanted the captions on, but he absolutely didn't listen to them.\n\nLast week I was clocked out for lunch so I decided to do some shopping. John saw me and called my name, then marched right up to me and very aggressively said \"You **need** to turn the captions off when you're done in the break room.\"\n\nMe: \"That's very [ableist](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism) of you to say, John.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn off the captions.\"\n\nMe: \"John, I'm shopping right now.\"\n\nThen I turned around and walked off to finish getting groceries.\n\nWhen I clocked in this past Monday, I immediately went to HR and told them that I was being intimidated by a coworker because of my disability. They said that they would follow up. I believe they left before they were able to talk to him.\n\nAt my store we announce when we are going to break over our radios so that people know if they need to watch that area. After I announced that I was going on lunch, I went to the break room and saw John's stuff sitting across from where I usually sit \\(by the TV so I can hear better\\), and immediately sat farther away near a coworker.\n\nShe told me that just before I got there John was ranting to a new coworker of ours that I always turn on the captions but that he wasn't going to let me, so he was going to hide the remote.\n\nI looked around and noticed that the remote was indeed missing. I was furious, so I got up to go talk to his immediate supervisor because this is absolutely ridiculous. I passed by John, who was putting something in his locker, and he sneered at me, saying, \"Looking for something, Carly?\"\n\nI didn't respond, but just walked past him and talked to his supervisor, who said he would talk to him. I also told my boss, and wrote down an account of what happened to give to HR.\n\nWhen I went back in to the break room I sat by my coworker again, and was talking with her. John kept trying to make conversation but I purposefully didn't look at him so I couldn't read his lips, but I was able to hear him say \"What, can she not hear me or something?\"\n\nHe sounded genuinely surprised that the Hard of Hearing girl who needs Closed Captioning might not be able to hear him, and even more surprised that I didn't want to talk to him after he purposefully hid the remote from me.\n\nLiterally Closed Captioning is just such an odd thing to be so violently opposed to, and he is probably the most \"Think Hearing\" person I've ever had the displeasure to work with. It's almost impressive how clueless he is.\n\nI had yesterday off, but will be working tonight. I'm curious what HR has to say, if they are there this evening.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I am honestly just astonished by this aggressive behavior.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot to tell you guys the best part of this entire situation! He doesn't even *watch* the TV most of the time. I've seen him turn off the CC or change the channel \\(without asking anyone else in the break room, he'll just grab the remote and change it\\), and then he will sit with his back to the TV and watch videos on his phone with the volume all the way up. He did this once when a *commercial* for American Idol came on, just grabbed the remote and changed the channel. I asked him why he changed the channel without asking and he just said \"I hate American Idol,\" and then turned around and watched videos on his phone, so I don't know what his deal is.  \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/8llwj8/workplace_bully_wont_let_me_have_cc/dzhlae0/) </author: Carlyndra>\n<author: Carlyndra indent=1> Update: I just got home from work.  \n\nI talked to HR again, and they said they were going to talk to John.

I work for a big box retail store. In our break room we have a television. I don't have a smartphone, but everyone else does, so I am typically the only one watching the TV.\n\nI always turn on Closed Captioning so I can understand what's going on, especially since there is a lot  of other noise \\(people talking, watching videos on their phones without headphones, loud box fans because it's hot\\).\n\nThere is an individual, who I'm going to call \"John,\" who hates Closed Captioning for some reason.\n\nI never turn off CC when my break is over.

I was trying to ask if they specifically want open captions only or if something like rear window captioning might be an acceptable alternative but they blocked me before I finished writing the question. \n\nI framed the question by explaining that on-screen captions plus camera movement can trigger my motion sickness, bc I was trying to Illustrate that open captions on all movies always might be more than a preference issue for some ppl, but they might have just assumed I was being stupid or argumentative or trolling. Which is fine. I am indeed stupid a lot and no one has to read my thoughts or answer my questions. \n\nBut I'm more concerned that there's maybe something about my question that was legitimately offensive. I tried googling it, but the only thing seems to be that rear window is prohibitively expensive so maybe that's not accessible if it can't be available equally? Or is open captioning preferred by the Deaf community bc it's very visible and automatic rather than just being an option ppl have to specifically seek out or try to find? Or some other reason? \n\nI genuinely want to learn people's opinions and perspectives. Im totally not passionate about rear window captioning or even movies and television at all. I'm not invested in the answer either way, but I do want to avoid being unintentionally hurtful or dismissive in the future and learn more about the topic in general. </author: iamasecretthrowaway>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: surdophobe toEvalutate=true/>\n    OK first of all rear-window captioning was a film-only thing. It went away about 11 years ago in the digital conversion. So please consider that in your search you are looking at very old data and very old arguments and obsolete restrictions against that data. \n\nBack then the only way for an open captioned movie to exist was to take a physical copy of the movie and use a laser to permanently etch the captions onto the film.  But now, every single theater and every single copy of the movie can be viewed with open captions. It just a matter of the projector operators loading into their equipment that way.  \n\n>I framed the question by explaining that on-screen captions plus camera movement can trigger my motion sickness,\n\nThat's quite a dubious claim, to be honest. I too would assume you were making shit up to be argumentive. \n\n>But I'm more concerned that there's maybe something about my question that was legitimately offensive.\n\nYou are extremely ill-informed about how bad the problem has been for the last 10+ years.  The tech that replaced rear-window captioning has been abysmal.

I was trying to ask if they specifically want open captions only or if something like rear window captioning might be an acceptable alternative but they blocked me before I finished writing the question. \n\nI framed the question by explaining that on-screen captions plus camera movement can trigger my motion sickness, bc I was trying to Illustrate that open captions on all movies always might be more than a preference issue for some ppl, but they might have just assumed I was being stupid or argumentative or trolling. Which is fine. I am indeed stupid a lot and no one has to read my thoughts or answer my questions. \n\nBut I'm more concerned that there's maybe something about my question that was legitimately offensive. I tried googling it, but the only thing seems to be that rear window is prohibitively expensive so maybe that's not accessible if it can't be available equally? Or is open captioning preferred by the Deaf community bc it's very visible and automatic rather than just being an option ppl have to specifically seek out or try to find? Or some other reason? \n\nI genuinely want to learn people's opinions and perspectives. Im totally not passionate about rear window captioning or even movies and television at all. I'm not invested in the answer either way, but I do want to avoid being unintentionally hurtful or dismissive in the future and learn more about the topic in general. </author: iamasecretthrowaway>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: surdophobe toEvalutate=true/>\n    OK first of all rear-window captioning was a film-only thing.

Recently, she did a round of interviews with right-wing media outlets, where she communicated in ASL with interpreters.\n\nHere are couple of interviews:\n\n[BlazeTV Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNSzVw_GX5c)\n\n[The Daily Moth's coverage with another interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bZPlgJ2q-4)\n\nThis caught the attention of the notorious deaf vlogger, Ricky Taylor. \n\nHe spoke about this with some people in the deaf community and someone recognized her. That someone told him her real name. \n\nRicky made a Threads post where he named DataRepublican\u2019s real identity\u2014Jennica Pounds\u2014which set off a firestorm on social media. Jennica responded with the following Twitter post:\n\n>I have been doxxed. Rather than let others control the narrative, I am addressing this directly.\n\n>My name is Jennica Pounds. I recently resigned from my job to pursue DOGE-adjacent efforts full-time. While my background check is still in progress, my ultimate goal is to work with the Administration to cut waste and improve efficiency.\n\n>What began as a side hobby became a mission when I uncovered the role of NGOs in these issues. This is not about left or right. This is about us\u2014the people.\n\n>I gave up everything for this\u2014my safety, my career\u2014because I believe in what I am doing.\n\n>I am 100% Deaf and nonverbal. My lack of signing fluency does not make me any less Deaf. It is a result of a language impairment related to my autism called expressive dysphasia, which affects my ability to construct language fluently in real-time. This impacts my signing, speaking, and even writing, though writing allows me more time to correct mistakes. My interpreter and I spend hours refining my talking points to ensure she conveys what I mean, not just what I say.\n\n>I am Deaf. And being Deaf is not, and should never be, defined by one\u2019s signing ability, particularly when there are medical conditions involved.\n\n>I do not believe the Deaf community should be politically aligned with any party. A priority of mine has always been holding the Administration accountable to Deaf Americans, including advocating for policy changes such as allowing a second interpreter camera stream on television broadcasts. I will continue using my platform to push for these necessary changes.\u201d\n\nHer post triggered a wave of MAGA supporters (mostly hearing people) who brigaded Ricky Taylor\u2019s latest vlog about USAID, posting his home address, descriptions of his house and car, and threats against him\u2014literally doxxing him.\n\nRicky responded in a hilariously defiant way, mocking them. \n\nThen, lo and behold, [Rolling Stone published an article about Jennica Pounds](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/elon-musk-data-republican-anonymous-data-expert-doge-tech-1235280817/).

But there\u2019s plenty of online discussion about how these people are on the government payroll, impacting American citizens, meaning their identities should be public.\n\n#My Take on This Drama\n\n***My Sympathy for Jennica***\n\nFirst, I want to address the backlash Jennica faced over her ASL skills. Many in the deaf community mocked her signing in the interview videos and even questioned whether she was actually deaf.\n\nIf you know me, you know I despise when people\u2014usually \u201cD\u201d Deaf community members\u2014judge deaf people with below-average ASL skills as \u2018not real Deaf.\u2019\n\nJennica explained that she is a nonverbal autistic deaf person. I\u2019ve met nonverbal autistic deaf people before, and I value them as part of our community. Just because her ASL isn\u2019t fluent or native doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not deaf. I see Jennica as one of us.\n\n#However\u2026\n\nThat said, I have zero sympathy for her role as a data/software engineer being used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling critical government functions that serve and protect disabled people\u2014all of us here.\n\nJennica claims Ricky doxxed her. That\u2019s bullshit. \n\nShe did public interviews showing her face. Yes, she wore sunglasses, but let\u2019s be real\u2014sunglasses aren\u2019t a disguise.\n\nShe was already newsworthy in the deaf community for being a deaf data/software engineer praised by Elon Musk and Charlie Kirk. She boasted about their praise on her website. She also made it publicly known she was joining DOGE.\n\nIt was inevitable that deaf people would start talking and someone would recognize her. Our community is too small for it not to happen.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Rolling Stone\u2019s article. Her endeavors with \"DataRepublicans\" were public enough to attract the attention from a major publication company. They went way deeper in exposing her background. Their criticism of Jennica was completely valid. That article was coming out regardless of Ricky's post. \n\nBy choosing to align herself with this effort, Jennica should have expected public scrutiny.\n\n#In Conclusion\u2026\n\nRicky did nothing wrong by naming her. It was going to happen anyway.\n\nAnd it\u2019s beyond hypocritical for right-wingers to accuse him of doxxing when they literally doxxed Ricky.\n\nSo here we are\u2014a deaf person in our community has aligned herself with an administration that is actively working against us. </author: HelensScarletFever>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: killerbrain toEvalutate=true/>\n    You said it well. It's extremely sad and pathetic that Jennica is assisting the same people working to destroy all the services she benefited from. She should not be attacked for her signing skills. She SHOULD be attacked for selling her community out.

I see Jennica as one of us.\n\n#However\u2026\n\nThat said, I have zero sympathy for her role as a data/software engineer being used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling critical government functions that serve and protect disabled people\u2014all of us here.\n\nJennica claims Ricky doxxed her. That\u2019s bullshit. \n\nShe did public interviews showing her face. Yes, she wore sunglasses, but let\u2019s be real\u2014sunglasses aren\u2019t a disguise.\n\nShe was already newsworthy in the deaf community for being a deaf data/software engineer praised by Elon Musk and Charlie Kirk. She boasted about their praise on her website. She also made it publicly known she was joining DOGE.\n\nIt was inevitable that deaf people would start talking and someone would recognize her. Our community is too small for it not to happen.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Rolling Stone\u2019s article. Her endeavors with \"DataRepublicans\" were public enough to attract the attention from a major publication company. They went way deeper in exposing her background. Their criticism of Jennica was completely valid. That article was coming out regardless of Ricky's post. \n\nBy choosing to align herself with this effort, Jennica should have expected public scrutiny.\n\n#In Conclusion\u2026\n\nRicky did nothing wrong by naming her. It was going to happen anyway.\n\nAnd it\u2019s beyond hypocritical for right-wingers to accuse him of doxxing when they literally doxxed Ricky.\n\nSo here we are\u2014a deaf person in our community has aligned herself with an administration that is actively working against us. </author: HelensScarletFever>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: killerbrain toEvalutate=true/>\n    You said it well. It's extremely sad and pathetic that Jennica is assisting the same people working to destroy all the services she benefited from. She should not be attacked for her signing skills. She SHOULD be attacked for selling her community out. She, too, will find herself as fucked as the rest of us when she's no longer useful to this group.\n   </ author: killerbrain/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s an app I can download for my phone. I\u2019m going to the movies next week. I don\u2019t go often and I really don\u2019t want to have to ask for the closed caption device. TIA!  </author: alittlefaith530>\n<author: Kuildeous indent=1> Why not the closed caption device? Is it the fear of battery power? I had that situation with one theatre where twice the device ran out of juice. I suspect that it's negligent employees not fully charging them, but the owner said that he would investigate. Sometimes batteries go bad, so maybe he needs to replace them. \n\nI would be curious about a phone app because there's very little I can imagine that wouldn't intrude on other people's viewing pleasure, unlike the closed caption devices. \n\nAlso, caption algorithms have a long ways to go, so I would only trust professionally transcribed captions. \n\nI may check out Live Transcribe for those older movies that don't have captions loaded. </author: Kuildeous>\n<author: alittlefaith530 indent=2> That is a very good point about the phone. \n\nIt\u2019s fear of taking it away from someone who might need it more than I do. I have moderate/severe (almost profound) loss but only in one ear. I can and have managed, but for this movie I would prefer to get all of the dialog. The device would greatly help me but I wouldn\u2019t want to take it from someone who needs it more than I do. </author: alittlefaith530>\n<author: Kuildeous indent=3> That's considerate of you. From my experience, I haven't see these caption devices run out. I suppose it could be worth waiting until 5 minutes before the movie and then check in with them if they have one available. \n\nBut hearing loss is hearing loss. If you need captions to fully understand the movie, I don't think we can really say you're less deserving of this assistance than others. \n\nEspecially since movies nowadays are so freakin' loud that dialogue gets swallowed up more often than not. \n\nI've seen some theatres offer open captions for select viewings. I may have to give that a try. Still not a common occurrence, so good luck finding one of those. </author: Kuildeous>\n<author: alittlefaith530 indent=4> Thank you. That means a lot to me.

The problem with OIC Movies is that most of their videos are not publicly available and not all of the videos have captions. I hope there are public ASL talks in the form of TED talks with accurate translations. Any pointers on such collections of videos? </author: Zia_0216>\n<author: [deleted] indent=1> If you want TED Talks by deaf people, this playlist has a lot. Some are by signers, and some are not. I see some that seem to be by hearing people talking about deaf people (like technology for the deaf/hoh). \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA17E58E99C442771 \n\nIf those aren\u2019t to your satisfaction, let us know what else you\u2019re looking for, so we can find better videos. I also enjoy Melmira, which is a show that\u2019s more focused on human stories and lifestyles, so it\u2019s more interview-heavy, but interesting to me.

I think I\u2019ll spend a lot of time on them. I\u2019m probably asking for too much. Do you know where I can find more videos that have only one narrators / signers sitting in the center?

It\u2019s a much better film and they actually do a decent job of representing sign language and one person\u2019s experience of being Deaf. It\u2019s also jus a good movie. \nIn general, be wary of using commercial films as a sign language teacher. They\u2019re not always as accurate as they should be and as people want them to be.

I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s an app I can download for my phone. I\u2019m going to the movies next week. I don\u2019t go often and I really don\u2019t want to have to ask for the closed caption device. TIA!  </author: alittlefaith530>\n<author: Kuildeous indent=1> Why not the closed caption device? Is it the fear of battery power? I had that situation with one theatre where twice the device ran out of juice. I suspect that it's negligent employees not fully charging them, but the owner said that he would investigate. Sometimes batteries go bad, so maybe he needs to replace them. \n\nI would be curious about a phone app because there's very little I can imagine that wouldn't intrude on other people's viewing pleasure, unlike the closed caption devices. \n\nAlso, caption algorithms have a long ways to go, so I would only trust professionally transcribed captions. \n\nI may check out Live Transcribe for those older movies that don't have captions loaded. </author: Kuildeous>\n<author: alittlefaith530 indent=2> That is a very good point about the phone. \n\nIt\u2019s fear of taking it away from someone who might need it more than I do. I have moderate/severe (almost profound) loss but only in one ear. I can and have managed, but for this movie I would prefer to get all of the dialog. The device would greatly help me but I wouldn\u2019t want to take it from someone who needs it more than I do. </author: alittlefaith530>\n<author: Kuildeous indent=3> That's considerate of you. From my experience, I haven't see these caption devices run out. I suppose it could be worth waiting until 5 minutes before the movie and then check in with them if they have one available. \n\nBut hearing loss is hearing loss. If you need captions to fully understand the movie, I don't think we can really say you're less deserving of this assistance than others. \n\nEspecially since movies nowadays are so freakin' loud that dialogue gets swallowed up more often than not. \n\nI've seen some theatres offer open captions for select viewings. I may have to give that a try. Still not a common occurrence, so good luck finding one of those. </author: Kuildeous>\n<author: alittlefaith530 indent=4> Thank you. That means a lot to me. Sometimes I don\u2019t feel deserving. \n\nOh yeah movies now are so hard. I\u2019m going to see the new Deadpool and they talk to fast in those movies. </author: alittlefaith530>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: Kuildeous toEvalutate=true/>\n    Ugh. I have to go rewatch the new Deadpool because the caption device *did* shut off 2/3 through. Sadly that was part of my earlier anecdote. Gonna give that theatre a pause while they gather their shit. I try not to rely on chain theatres, but I usually have good results with their caption devices.\n   </ author: Kuildeous/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

It also bugs me when people shrug off closed captions, which makes me anxious and nervous the next time to ask. \n\nPhone calls bug me. I prefer texting and video call over phone calls. We're lucky to have that these days. \n\nI'm tired of being told \"I'll tell you later\" because I know you'll forget.

I hate wearing my hearing aids and would prefer to just not. But it\u2019s hard to enforce my boundaries with hearing people who have never had to think about the way they communicate before. They\u2019re just used to mumbling to each other across the room and can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like not being able to hear it. And then you feel disheartened and tired asking repeatedly. And wondering how much information you miss all the time because they might be calling something out from over there. So frustrating.

I work for a big box retail store. In our break room we have a television. I don't have a smartphone, but everyone else does, so I am typically the only one watching the TV.\n\nI always turn on Closed Captioning so I can understand what's going on, especially since there is a lot  of other noise \\(people talking, watching videos on their phones without headphones, loud box fans because it's hot\\).\n\nThere is an individual, who I'm going to call \"John,\" who hates Closed Captioning for some reason.\n\nI never turn off CC when my break is over. Other people I work with have told me that they prefer it on because some of them also have hearing problems \\(but don't identify as Hard of Hearing\\), or they sit far away from the TV and can't hear it from where they are, or just because it helps them focus on what's happening. However, none of these people turn on the CC themselves, the just prefer it when it's already on, so I am the only one who switches it on.\n\nA few weeks ago I was on one of my breaks watching TV with CC when John walks up to me and says very firmly, \"Hey Carly, you need to turn the captions off when you're done.\"\n\nMe: \"Why?\"\n\nJohn: \"You're the only person in this store who has problems with their ears, so you need to turn the captions off.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not the only one who is Hard of Hearing in this store, there are other people who needs captions.\" \\(\\(At this time there were two other people who also identified as Hard of Hearing\\)\\)\n\nJohn: \"Oh yeah, who?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not outing people's medical conditions to you.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn the captions off.\"\n\nIt was a very odd interaction.\n\nSomething similar happened the next week, but this time I was sitting with two other people, and the entire time John was telling me that I need to turn off the captions, the other two were telling him that they wanted the captions on, but he absolutely didn't listen to them.\n\nLast week I was clocked out for lunch so I decided to do some shopping. John saw me and called my name, then marched right up to me and very aggressively said \"You **need** to turn the captions off when you're done in the break room.\"\n\nMe: \"That's very [ableist](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism) of you to say, John.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn off the captions.\"\n\nMe: \"John, I'm shopping right now.\"\n\nThen I turned around and walked off to finish getting groceries.\n\nWhen I clocked in this past Monday, I immediately went to HR and told them that I was being intimidated by a coworker because of my disability. They said that they would follow up. I believe they left before they were able to talk to him.\n\nAt my store we announce when we are going to break over our radios so that people know if they need to watch that area. After I announced that I was going on lunch, I went to the break room and saw John's stuff sitting across from where I usually sit \\(by the TV so I can hear better\\), and immediately sat farther away near a coworker.\n\nShe told me that just before I got there John was ranting to a new coworker of ours that I always turn on the captions but that he wasn't going to let me, so he was going to hide the remote.\n\nI looked around and noticed that the remote was indeed missing. I was furious, so I got up to go talk to his immediate supervisor because this is absolutely ridiculous. I passed by John, who was putting something in his locker, and he sneered at me, saying, \"Looking for something, Carly?\"\n\nI didn't respond, but just walked past him and talked to his supervisor, who said he would talk to him. I also told my boss, and wrote down an account of what happened to give to HR.\n\nWhen I went back in to the break room I sat by my coworker again, and was talking with her. John kept trying to make conversation but I purposefully didn't look at him so I couldn't read his lips, but I was able to hear him say \"What, can she not hear me or something?\"\n\nHe sounded genuinely surprised that the Hard of Hearing girl who needs Closed Captioning might not be able to hear him, and even more surprised that I didn't want to talk to him after he purposefully hid the remote from me.\n\nLiterally Closed Captioning is just such an odd thing to be so violently opposed to, and he is probably the most \"Think Hearing\" person I've ever had the displeasure to work with. It's almost impressive how clueless he is.\n\nI had yesterday off, but will be working tonight. I'm curious what HR has to say, if they are there this evening.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I am honestly just astonished by this aggressive behavior.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot to tell you guys the best part of this entire situation! He doesn't even *watch* the TV most of the time. I've seen him turn off the CC or change the channel \\(without asking anyone else in the break room, he'll just grab the remote and change it\\), and then he will sit with his back to the TV and watch videos on his phone with the volume all the way up. He did this once when a *commercial* for American Idol came on, just grabbed the remote and changed the channel. I asked him why he changed the channel without asking and he just said \"I hate American Idol,\" and then turned around and watched videos on his phone, so I don't know what his deal is.  \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/8llwj8/workplace_bully_wont_let_me_have_cc/dzhlae0/) </author: Carlyndra>\n<author: Carlyndra indent=1> Update: I just got home from work.  \n\nI talked to HR again, and they said they were going to talk to John. John is now no longer allowed to speak to me in any capacity, and if I'm able to I'm allowed to try to take my breaks at different times than him.  \n\nI pushed my HR for more info, and they said they are partnering with the person one step above them, but if John doesn't say or do anything else, then this is the end of it, and they aren't going to pursue any further corrective action.   </author: Carlyndra>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: pilotavery toEvalutate=true/>\n    From what you've explained, I don't think he's going to last very long.\n   </ author: pilotavery/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

However, none of these people turn on the CC themselves, the just prefer it when it's already on, so I am the only one who switches it on.\n\nA few weeks ago I was on one of my breaks watching TV with CC when John walks up to me and says very firmly, \"Hey Carly, you need to turn the captions off when you're done.\"\n\nMe: \"Why?\"\n\nJohn: \"You're the only person in this store who has problems with their ears, so you need to turn the captions off.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not the only one who is Hard of Hearing in this store, there are other people who needs captions.\" \\(\\(At this time there were two other people who also identified as Hard of Hearing\\)\\)\n\nJohn: \"Oh yeah, who?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not outing people's medical conditions to you.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn the captions off.\"\n\nIt was a very odd interaction.\n\nSomething similar happened the next week, but this time I was sitting with two other people, and the entire time John was telling me that I need to turn off the captions, the other two were telling him that they wanted the captions on, but he absolutely didn't listen to them.\n\nLast week I was clocked out for lunch so I decided to do some shopping. John saw me and called my name, then marched right up to me and very aggressively said \"You **need** to turn the captions off when you're done in the break room.\"\n\nMe: \"That's very [ableist](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism) of you to say, John.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn off the captions.\"\n\nMe: \"John, I'm shopping right now.\"\n\nThen I turned around and walked off to finish getting groceries.\n\nWhen I clocked in this past Monday, I immediately went to HR and told them that I was being intimidated by a coworker because of my disability. They said that they would follow up. I believe they left before they were able to talk to him.\n\nAt my store we announce when we are going to break over our radios so that people know if they need to watch that area. After I announced that I was going on lunch, I went to the break room and saw John's stuff sitting across from where I usually sit \\(by the TV so I can hear better\\), and immediately sat farther away near a coworker.\n\nShe told me that just before I got there John was ranting to a new coworker of ours that I always turn on the captions but that he wasn't going to let me, so he was going to hide the remote.\n\nI looked around and noticed that the remote was indeed missing. I was furious, so I got up to go talk to his immediate supervisor because this is absolutely ridiculous. I passed by John, who was putting something in his locker, and he sneered at me, saying, \"Looking for something, Carly?\"\n\nI didn't respond, but just walked past him and talked to his supervisor, who said he would talk to him. I also told my boss, and wrote down an account of what happened to give to HR.\n\nWhen I went back in to the break room I sat by my coworker again, and was talking with her. John kept trying to make conversation but I purposefully didn't look at him so I couldn't read his lips, but I was able to hear him say \"What, can she not hear me or something?\"\n\nHe sounded genuinely surprised that the Hard of Hearing girl who needs Closed Captioning might not be able to hear him, and even more surprised that I didn't want to talk to him after he purposefully hid the remote from me.\n\nLiterally Closed Captioning is just such an odd thing to be so violently opposed to, and he is probably the most \"Think Hearing\" person I've ever had the displeasure to work with. It's almost impressive how clueless he is.\n\nI had yesterday off, but will be working tonight. I'm curious what HR has to say, if they are there this evening.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I am honestly just astonished by this aggressive behavior.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot to tell you guys the best part of this entire situation! He doesn't even *watch* the TV most of the time. I've seen him turn off the CC or change the channel \\(without asking anyone else in the break room, he'll just grab the remote and change it\\), and then he will sit with his back to the TV and watch videos on his phone with the volume all the way up. He did this once when a *commercial* for American Idol came on, just grabbed the remote and changed the channel. I asked him why he changed the channel without asking and he just said \"I hate American Idol,\" and then turned around and watched videos on his phone, so I don't know what his deal is.  \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/8llwj8/workplace_bully_wont_let_me_have_cc/dzhlae0/) </author: Carlyndra>\n<author: Carlyndra indent=1> Update: I just got home from work.  \n\nI talked to HR again, and they said they were going to talk to John.

I work for a big box retail store. In our break room we have a television.

I was trying to ask if they specifically want open captions only or if something like rear window captioning might be an acceptable alternative but they blocked me before I finished writing the question. \n\nI framed the question by explaining that on-screen captions plus camera movement can trigger my motion sickness, bc I was trying to Illustrate that open captions on all movies always might be more than a preference issue for some ppl, but they might have just assumed I was being stupid or argumentative or trolling. Which is fine. I am indeed stupid a lot and no one has to read my thoughts or answer my questions. \n\nBut I'm more concerned that there's maybe something about my question that was legitimately offensive. I tried googling it, but the only thing seems to be that rear window is prohibitively expensive so maybe that's not accessible if it can't be available equally? Or is open captioning preferred by the Deaf community bc it's very visible and automatic rather than just being an option ppl have to specifically seek out or try to find? Or some other reason? \n\nI genuinely want to learn people's opinions and perspectives. Im totally not passionate about rear window captioning or even movies and television at all. I'm not invested in the answer either way, but I do want to avoid being unintentionally hurtful or dismissive in the future and learn more about the topic in general. </author: iamasecretthrowaway>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: surdophobe toEvalutate=true/>\n    OK first of all rear-window captioning was a film-only thing. It went away about 11 years ago in the digital conversion. So please consider that in your search you are looking at very old data and very old arguments and obsolete restrictions against that data. \n\nBack then the only way for an open captioned movie to exist was to take a physical copy of the movie and use a laser to permanently etch the captions onto the film.  But now, every single theater and every single copy of the movie can be viewed with open captions. It just a matter of the projector operators loading into their equipment that way.  \n\n>I framed the question by explaining that on-screen captions plus camera movement can trigger my motion sickness,\n\nThat's quite a dubious claim, to be honest. I too would assume you were making shit up to be argumentive. \n\n>But I'm more concerned that there's maybe something about my question that was legitimately offensive.\n\nYou are extremely ill-informed about how bad the problem has been for the last 10+ years.  The tech that replaced rear-window captioning has been abysmal.

I was trying to ask if they specifically want open captions only or if something like rear window captioning might be an acceptable alternative but they blocked me before I finished writing the question. \n\nI framed the question by explaining that on-screen captions plus camera movement can trigger my motion sickness, bc I was trying to Illustrate that open captions on all movies always might be more than a preference issue for some ppl, but they might have just assumed I was being stupid or argumentative or trolling. Which is fine. I am indeed stupid a lot and no one has to read my thoughts or answer my questions. \n\nBut I'm more concerned that there's maybe something about my question that was legitimately offensive. I tried googling it, but the only thing seems to be that rear window is prohibitively expensive so maybe that's not accessible if it can't be available equally? Or is open captioning preferred by the Deaf community bc it's very visible and automatic rather than just being an option ppl have to specifically seek out or try to find? Or some other reason? \n\nI genuinely want to learn people's opinions and perspectives. Im totally not passionate about rear window captioning or even movies and television at all.

Recently, she did a round of interviews with right-wing media outlets, where she communicated in ASL with interpreters.\n\nHere are couple of interviews:\n\n[BlazeTV Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNSzVw_GX5c)\n\n[The Daily Moth's coverage with another interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bZPlgJ2q-4)\n\nThis caught the attention of the notorious deaf vlogger, Ricky Taylor. \n\nHe spoke about this with some people in the deaf community and someone recognized her. That someone told him her real name. \n\nRicky made a Threads post where he named DataRepublican\u2019s real identity\u2014Jennica Pounds\u2014which set off a firestorm on social media. Jennica responded with the following Twitter post:\n\n>I have been doxxed. Rather than let others control the narrative, I am addressing this directly.\n\n>My name is Jennica Pounds. I recently resigned from my job to pursue DOGE-adjacent efforts full-time. While my background check is still in progress, my ultimate goal is to work with the Administration to cut waste and improve efficiency.\n\n>What began as a side hobby became a mission when I uncovered the role of NGOs in these issues. This is not about left or right. This is about us\u2014the people.\n\n>I gave up everything for this\u2014my safety, my career\u2014because I believe in what I am doing.\n\n>I am 100% Deaf and nonverbal. My lack of signing fluency does not make me any less Deaf. It is a result of a language impairment related to my autism called expressive dysphasia, which affects my ability to construct language fluently in real-time. This impacts my signing, speaking, and even writing, though writing allows me more time to correct mistakes. My interpreter and I spend hours refining my talking points to ensure she conveys what I mean, not just what I say.\n\n>I am Deaf. And being Deaf is not, and should never be, defined by one\u2019s signing ability, particularly when there are medical conditions involved.\n\n>I do not believe the Deaf community should be politically aligned with any party. A priority of mine has always been holding the Administration accountable to Deaf Americans, including advocating for policy changes such as allowing a second interpreter camera stream on television broadcasts. I will continue using my platform to push for these necessary changes.\u201d\n\nHer post triggered a wave of MAGA supporters (mostly hearing people) who brigaded Ricky Taylor\u2019s latest vlog about USAID, posting his home address, descriptions of his house and car, and threats against him\u2014literally doxxing him.\n\nRicky responded in a hilariously defiant way, mocking them. \n\nThen, lo and behold, [Rolling Stone published an article about Jennica Pounds](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/elon-musk-data-republican-anonymous-data-expert-doge-tech-1235280817/).

But there\u2019s plenty of online discussion about how these people are on the government payroll, impacting American citizens, meaning their identities should be public.\n\n#My Take on This Drama\n\n***My Sympathy for Jennica***\n\nFirst, I want to address the backlash Jennica faced over her ASL skills. Many in the deaf community mocked her signing in the interview videos and even questioned whether she was actually deaf.\n\nIf you know me, you know I despise when people\u2014usually \u201cD\u201d Deaf community members\u2014judge deaf people with below-average ASL skills as \u2018not real Deaf.\u2019\n\nJennica explained that she is a nonverbal autistic deaf person. I\u2019ve met nonverbal autistic deaf people before, and I value them as part of our community. Just because her ASL isn\u2019t fluent or native doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not deaf. I see Jennica as one of us.\n\n#However\u2026\n\nThat said, I have zero sympathy for her role as a data/software engineer being used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling critical government functions that serve and protect disabled people\u2014all of us here.\n\nJennica claims Ricky doxxed her. That\u2019s bullshit. \n\nShe did public interviews showing her face. Yes, she wore sunglasses, but let\u2019s be real\u2014sunglasses aren\u2019t a disguise.\n\nShe was already newsworthy in the deaf community for being a deaf data/software engineer praised by Elon Musk and Charlie Kirk. She boasted about their praise on her website. She also made it publicly known she was joining DOGE.\n\nIt was inevitable that deaf people would start talking and someone would recognize her. Our community is too small for it not to happen.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Rolling Stone\u2019s article. Her endeavors with \"DataRepublicans\" were public enough to attract the attention from a major publication company. They went way deeper in exposing her background. Their criticism of Jennica was completely valid. That article was coming out regardless of Ricky's post. \n\nBy choosing to align herself with this effort, Jennica should have expected public scrutiny.\n\n#In Conclusion\u2026\n\nRicky did nothing wrong by naming her. It was going to happen anyway.\n\nAnd it\u2019s beyond hypocritical for right-wingers to accuse him of doxxing when they literally doxxed Ricky.\n\nSo here we are\u2014a deaf person in our community has aligned herself with an administration that is actively working against us. </author: HelensScarletFever>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: killerbrain toEvalutate=true/>\n    You said it well. It's extremely sad and pathetic that Jennica is assisting the same people working to destroy all the services she benefited from. She should not be attacked for her signing skills. She SHOULD be attacked for selling her community out. She, too, will find herself as fucked as the rest of us when she's no longer useful to this group.\n   </ author: killerbrain/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

Recently, she did a round of interviews with right-wing media outlets, where she communicated in ASL with interpreters.\n\nHere are couple of interviews:\n\n[BlazeTV Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNSzVw_GX5c)\n\n[The Daily Moth's coverage with another interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bZPlgJ2q-4)\n\nThis caught the attention of the notorious deaf vlogger, Ricky Taylor. \n\nHe spoke about this with some people in the deaf community and someone recognized her. That someone told him her real name. \n\nRicky made a Threads post where he named DataRepublican\u2019s real identity\u2014Jennica Pounds\u2014which set off a firestorm on social media. Jennica responded with the following Twitter post:\n\n>I have been doxxed. Rather than let others control the narrative, I am addressing this directly.\n\n>My name is Jennica Pounds.

I\u2019ve met nonverbal autistic deaf people before, and I value them as part of our community. Just because her ASL isn\u2019t fluent or native doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not deaf. I see Jennica as one of us.\n\n#However\u2026\n\nThat said, I have zero sympathy for her role as a data/software engineer being used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling critical government functions that serve and protect disabled people\u2014all of us here.\n\nJennica claims Ricky doxxed her. That\u2019s bullshit. \n\nShe did public interviews showing her face. Yes, she wore sunglasses, but let\u2019s be real\u2014sunglasses aren\u2019t a disguise.\n\nShe was already newsworthy in the deaf community for being a deaf data/software engineer praised by Elon Musk and Charlie Kirk. She boasted about their praise on her website. She also made it publicly known she was joining DOGE.\n\nIt was inevitable that deaf people would start talking and someone would recognize her. Our community is too small for it not to happen.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Rolling Stone\u2019s article. Her endeavors with \"DataRepublicans\" were public enough to attract the attention from a major publication company. They went way deeper in exposing her background. Their criticism of Jennica was completely valid. That article was coming out regardless of Ricky's post. \n\nBy choosing to align herself with this effort, Jennica should have expected public scrutiny.\n\n#In Conclusion\u2026\n\nRicky did nothing wrong by naming her. It was going to happen anyway.\n\nAnd it\u2019s beyond hypocritical for right-wingers to accuse him of doxxing when they literally doxxed Ricky.\n\nSo here we are\u2014a deaf person in our community has aligned herself with an administration that is actively working against us. </author: HelensScarletFever>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: killerbrain toEvalutate=true/>\n    You said it well. It's extremely sad and pathetic that Jennica is assisting the same people working to destroy all the services she benefited from. She should not be attacked for her signing skills. She SHOULD be attacked for selling her community out. She, too, will find herself as fucked as the rest of us when she's no longer useful to this group.\n   </ author: killerbrain/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s an app I can download for my phone. I\u2019m going to the movies next week. I don\u2019t go often and I really don\u2019t want to have to ask for the closed caption device. TIA!  </author: alittlefaith530>\n<author: Kuildeous indent=1> Why not the closed caption device? Is it the fear of battery power? I had that situation with one theatre where twice the device ran out of juice. I suspect that it's negligent employees not fully charging them, but the owner said that he would investigate. Sometimes batteries go bad, so maybe he needs to replace them. \n\nI would be curious about a phone app because there's very little I can imagine that wouldn't intrude on other people's viewing pleasure, unlike the closed caption devices. \n\nAlso, caption algorithms have a long ways to go, so I would only trust professionally transcribed captions. \n\nI may check out Live Transcribe for those older movies that don't have captions loaded. </author: Kuildeous>\n<author: alittlefaith530 indent=2> That is a very good point about the phone. \n\nIt\u2019s fear of taking it away from someone who might need it more than I do. I have moderate/severe (almost profound) loss but only in one ear. I can and have managed, but for this movie I would prefer to get all of the dialog. The device would greatly help me but I wouldn\u2019t want to take it from someone who needs it more than I do. </author: alittlefaith530>\n<author: Kuildeous indent=3> That's considerate of you. From my experience, I haven't see these caption devices run out. I suppose it could be worth waiting until 5 minutes before the movie and then check in with them if they have one available. \n\nBut hearing loss is hearing loss. If you need captions to fully understand the movie, I don't think we can really say you're less deserving of this assistance than others. \n\nEspecially since movies nowadays are so freakin' loud that dialogue gets swallowed up more often than not. \n\nI've seen some theatres offer open captions for select viewings. I may have to give that a try. Still not a common occurrence, so good luck finding one of those. </author: Kuildeous>\n<author: alittlefaith530 indent=4> Thank you. That means a lot to me. Sometimes I don\u2019t feel deserving. \n\nOh yeah movies now are so hard.

The problem with OIC Movies is that most of their videos are not publicly available and not all of the videos have captions. I hope there are public ASL talks in the form of TED talks with accurate translations. Any pointers on such collections of videos? </author: Zia_0216>\n<author: [deleted] indent=1> If you want TED Talks by deaf people, this playlist has a lot. Some are by signers, and some are not. I see some that seem to be by hearing people talking about deaf people (like technology for the deaf/hoh). \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA17E58E99C442771 \n\nIf those aren\u2019t to your satisfaction, let us know what else you\u2019re looking for, so we can find better videos. I also enjoy Melmira, which is a show that\u2019s more focused on human stories and lifestyles, so it\u2019s more interview-heavy, but interesting to me. Melmira is on YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram, I believe. </author: [deleted]>\n<author: Zia_0216 indent=2> Thanks a lot!!! The TED talk playlist is awesome! Melmira is also great! I think I\u2019ll spend a lot of time on them. I\u2019m probably asking for too much. Do you know where I can find more videos that have only one narrators / signers sitting in the center? I\u2019m enjoying some of the vlogs made by The Stews at YouTube. </author: Zia_0216>\n<author: [deleted] indent=3> Like the Daily Moth?

It\u2019s a much better film and they actually do a decent job of representing sign language and one person\u2019s experience of being Deaf. It\u2019s also jus a good movie. \nIn general, be wary of using commercial films as a sign language teacher. They\u2019re not always as accurate as they should be and as people want them to be.

I work for a big box retail store. In our break room we have a television. I don't have a smartphone, but everyone else does, so I am typically the only one watching the TV.\n\nI always turn on Closed Captioning so I can understand what's going on, especially since there is a lot  of other noise \\(people talking, watching videos on their phones without headphones, loud box fans because it's hot\\).\n\nThere is an individual, who I'm going to call \"John,\" who hates Closed Captioning for some reason.\n\nI never turn off CC when my break is over. Other people I work with have told me that they prefer it on because some of them also have hearing problems \\(but don't identify as Hard of Hearing\\), or they sit far away from the TV and can't hear it from where they are, or just because it helps them focus on what's happening. However, none of these people turn on the CC themselves, the just prefer it when it's already on, so I am the only one who switches it on.\n\nA few weeks ago I was on one of my breaks watching TV with CC when John walks up to me and says very firmly, \"Hey Carly, you need to turn the captions off when you're done.\"\n\nMe: \"Why?\"\n\nJohn: \"You're the only person in this store who has problems with their ears, so you need to turn the captions off.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not the only one who is Hard of Hearing in this store, there are other people who needs captions.\" \\(\\(At this time there were two other people who also identified as Hard of Hearing\\)\\)\n\nJohn: \"Oh yeah, who?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not outing people's medical conditions to you.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn the captions off.\"\n\nIt was a very odd interaction.\n\nSomething similar happened the next week, but this time I was sitting with two other people, and the entire time John was telling me that I need to turn off the captions, the other two were telling him that they wanted the captions on, but he absolutely didn't listen to them.\n\nLast week I was clocked out for lunch so I decided to do some shopping. John saw me and called my name, then marched right up to me and very aggressively said \"You **need** to turn the captions off when you're done in the break room.\"\n\nMe: \"That's very [ableist](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism) of you to say, John.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn off the captions.\"\n\nMe: \"John, I'm shopping right now.\"\n\nThen I turned around and walked off to finish getting groceries.\n\nWhen I clocked in this past Monday, I immediately went to HR and told them that I was being intimidated by a coworker because of my disability. They said that they would follow up. I believe they left before they were able to talk to him.\n\nAt my store we announce when we are going to break over our radios so that people know if they need to watch that area. After I announced that I was going on lunch, I went to the break room and saw John's stuff sitting across from where I usually sit \\(by the TV so I can hear better\\), and immediately sat farther away near a coworker.\n\nShe told me that just before I got there John was ranting to a new coworker of ours that I always turn on the captions but that he wasn't going to let me, so he was going to hide the remote.\n\nI looked around and noticed that the remote was indeed missing. I was furious, so I got up to go talk to his immediate supervisor because this is absolutely ridiculous. I passed by John, who was putting something in his locker, and he sneered at me, saying, \"Looking for something, Carly?\"\n\nI didn't respond, but just walked past him and talked to his supervisor, who said he would talk to him. I also told my boss, and wrote down an account of what happened to give to HR.\n\nWhen I went back in to the break room I sat by my coworker again, and was talking with her. John kept trying to make conversation but I purposefully didn't look at him so I couldn't read his lips, but I was able to hear him say \"What, can she not hear me or something?\"\n\nHe sounded genuinely surprised that the Hard of Hearing girl who needs Closed Captioning might not be able to hear him, and even more surprised that I didn't want to talk to him after he purposefully hid the remote from me.\n\nLiterally Closed Captioning is just such an odd thing to be so violently opposed to, and he is probably the most \"Think Hearing\" person I've ever had the displeasure to work with. It's almost impressive how clueless he is.\n\nI had yesterday off, but will be working tonight. I'm curious what HR has to say, if they are there this evening.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I am honestly just astonished by this aggressive behavior.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot to tell you guys the best part of this entire situation! He doesn't even *watch* the TV most of the time. I've seen him turn off the CC or change the channel \\(without asking anyone else in the break room, he'll just grab the remote and change it\\), and then he will sit with his back to the TV and watch videos on his phone with the volume all the way up. He did this once when a *commercial* for American Idol came on, just grabbed the remote and changed the channel. I asked him why he changed the channel without asking and he just said \"I hate American Idol,\" and then turned around and watched videos on his phone, so I don't know what his deal is.  \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/8llwj8/workplace_bully_wont_let_me_have_cc/dzhlae0/) </author: Carlyndra>\n<author: Carlyndra indent=1> Update: I just got home from work.  \n\nI talked to HR again, and they said they were going to talk to John. John is now no longer allowed to speak to me in any capacity, and if I'm able to I'm allowed to try to take my breaks at different times than him.  \n\nI pushed my HR for more info, and they said they are partnering with the person one step above them, but if John doesn't say or do anything else, then this is the end of it, and they aren't going to pursue any further corrective action.   </author: Carlyndra>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: pilotavery toEvalutate=true/>\n    From what you've explained, I don't think he's going to last very long.\n   </ author: pilotavery/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

We (the network) would like to create a show in which the deaf community is our first priority. We will have the characters use American sign language to communicate. However, I'd also like to know what you (the deaf community) feel is missing in television when it comes to making your experience more enjoyable while consuming content. Please let me know what you would like to see more of in television! The more details, the better. </author: underthemoonlight08>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: Distracted-by-Shiny toEvalutate=true/>\n    Accurate captions - the absolute #1 thing\n\nMaybe show how hearing people can communicate with deaf by using phone apps\n\nMaybe show the pros and cons of interactions with and without hearing aids\n\nIf it\u2019s America, you can show how awful our medical system, employment, & disability is for deaf people. \n\nMaybe show a combination of hearing and deaf people. Deaf people are part of the world.\n\nMy first thought about a Sci Fi deaf show is how scary being in the dark is if you can\u2019t hear.\n\nIt sucks to be in the dark. I try not to go out at night.\n\nMy son likes to sneak up and scare me for fun after I go to bed. It\u2019s kinda a fun game we play. I can\u2019t hear him sneaking in the dark but I look for visual cues. He\u2019s gotten me real good a couple of times.\n\nI\u2019m an easy scare at haunted houses.\n\nOn the plus side, I have excellent visual memory and can tell you if something has moved or where it was last seen. It\u2019s like detective show accurate. If it\u2019s moved an inch, I\u2019ve noticed.\n   </ author: Distracted-by-Shiny/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

We (the network) would like to create a show in which the deaf community is our first priority. We will have the characters use American sign language to communicate. However, I'd also like to know what you (the deaf community) feel is missing in television when it comes to making your experience more enjoyable while consuming content. Please let me know what you would like to see more of in television! The more details, the better. </author: underthemoonlight08>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: Distracted-by-Shiny toEvalutate=true/>\n    Accurate captions - the absolute #1 thing\n\nMaybe show how hearing people can communicate with deaf by using phone apps\n\nMaybe show the pros and cons of interactions with and without hearing aids\n\nIf it\u2019s America, you can show how awful our medical system, employment, & disability is for deaf people. \n\nMaybe show a combination of hearing and deaf people. Deaf people are part of the world.\n\nMy first thought about a Sci Fi deaf show is how scary being in the dark is if you can\u2019t hear.\n\nIt sucks to be in the dark. I try not to go out at night.\n\nMy son likes to sneak up and scare me for fun after I go to bed. It\u2019s kinda a fun game we play. I can\u2019t hear him sneaking in the dark but I look for visual cues. He\u2019s gotten me real good a couple of times.\n\nI\u2019m an easy scare at haunted houses.\n\nOn the plus side, I have excellent visual memory and can tell you if something has moved or where it was last seen. It\u2019s like detective show accurate. If it\u2019s moved an inch, I\u2019ve noticed.\n   </ author: Distracted-by-Shiny/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

My name is Chris and I have had high frequency hearing loss all of my life, since birth. I am a software developer and this is an iPhone app I developed that generates live transcriptions allowing you to see captions of speech, then save them as transcripts, and then print, email, or text the transcripts. This is a beta version, but it is free to download and use from the\u00a0[apple app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/livecaptionsai/id6464103487).

It\u2019s a much better film and they actually do a decent job of representing sign language and one person\u2019s experience of being Deaf. It\u2019s also jus a good movie. \nIn general, be wary of using commercial films as a sign language teacher. They\u2019re not always as accurate as they should be and as people want them to be.

It also bugs me when people shrug off closed captions, which makes me anxious and nervous the next time to ask. \n\nPhone calls bug me. I prefer texting and video call over phone calls.

I work for a big box retail store. In our break room we have a television. I don't have a smartphone, but everyone else does, so I am typically the only one watching the TV.\n\nI always turn on Closed Captioning so I can understand what's going on, especially since there is a lot  of other noise \\(people talking, watching videos on their phones without headphones, loud box fans because it's hot\\).\n\nThere is an individual, who I'm going to call \"John,\" who hates Closed Captioning for some reason.\n\nI never turn off CC when my break is over. Other people I work with have told me that they prefer it on because some of them also have hearing problems \\(but don't identify as Hard of Hearing\\), or they sit far away from the TV and can't hear it from where they are, or just because it helps them focus on what's happening. However, none of these people turn on the CC themselves, the just prefer it when it's already on, so I am the only one who switches it on.\n\nA few weeks ago I was on one of my breaks watching TV with CC when John walks up to me and says very firmly, \"Hey Carly, you need to turn the captions off when you're done.\"\n\nMe: \"Why?\"\n\nJohn: \"You're the only person in this store who has problems with their ears, so you need to turn the captions off.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not the only one who is Hard of Hearing in this store, there are other people who needs captions.\" \\(\\(At this time there were two other people who also identified as Hard of Hearing\\)\\)\n\nJohn: \"Oh yeah, who?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not outing people's medical conditions to you.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn the captions off.\"\n\nIt was a very odd interaction.\n\nSomething similar happened the next week, but this time I was sitting with two other people, and the entire time John was telling me that I need to turn off the captions, the other two were telling him that they wanted the captions on, but he absolutely didn't listen to them.\n\nLast week I was clocked out for lunch so I decided to do some shopping. John saw me and called my name, then marched right up to me and very aggressively said \"You **need** to turn the captions off when you're done in the break room.\"\n\nMe: \"That's very [ableist](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism) of you to say, John.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn off the captions.\"\n\nMe: \"John, I'm shopping right now.\"\n\nThen I turned around and walked off to finish getting groceries.\n\nWhen I clocked in this past Monday, I immediately went to HR and told them that I was being intimidated by a coworker because of my disability. They said that they would follow up. I believe they left before they were able to talk to him.\n\nAt my store we announce when we are going to break over our radios so that people know if they need to watch that area. After I announced that I was going on lunch, I went to the break room and saw John's stuff sitting across from where I usually sit \\(by the TV so I can hear better\\), and immediately sat farther away near a coworker.\n\nShe told me that just before I got there John was ranting to a new coworker of ours that I always turn on the captions but that he wasn't going to let me, so he was going to hide the remote.\n\nI looked around and noticed that the remote was indeed missing. I was furious, so I got up to go talk to his immediate supervisor because this is absolutely ridiculous. I passed by John, who was putting something in his locker, and he sneered at me, saying, \"Looking for something, Carly?\"\n\nI didn't respond, but just walked past him and talked to his supervisor, who said he would talk to him. I also told my boss, and wrote down an account of what happened to give to HR.\n\nWhen I went back in to the break room I sat by my coworker again, and was talking with her. John kept trying to make conversation but I purposefully didn't look at him so I couldn't read his lips, but I was able to hear him say \"What, can she not hear me or something?\"\n\nHe sounded genuinely surprised that the Hard of Hearing girl who needs Closed Captioning might not be able to hear him, and even more surprised that I didn't want to talk to him after he purposefully hid the remote from me.\n\nLiterally Closed Captioning is just such an odd thing to be so violently opposed to, and he is probably the most \"Think Hearing\" person I've ever had the displeasure to work with. It's almost impressive how clueless he is.\n\nI had yesterday off, but will be working tonight. I'm curious what HR has to say, if they are there this evening.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I am honestly just astonished by this aggressive behavior.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot to tell you guys the best part of this entire situation! He doesn't even *watch* the TV most of the time. I've seen him turn off the CC or change the channel \\(without asking anyone else in the break room, he'll just grab the remote and change it\\), and then he will sit with his back to the TV and watch videos on his phone with the volume all the way up. He did this once when a *commercial* for American Idol came on, just grabbed the remote and changed the channel. I asked him why he changed the channel without asking and he just said \"I hate American Idol,\" and then turned around and watched videos on his phone, so I don't know what his deal is.  \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/8llwj8/workplace_bully_wont_let_me_have_cc/dzhlae0/) </author: Carlyndra>\n<author: Carlyndra indent=1> Update: I just got home from work.  \n\nI talked to HR again, and they said they were going to talk to John. John is now no longer allowed to speak to me in any capacity, and if I'm able to I'm allowed to try to take my breaks at different times than him.  \n\nI pushed my HR for more info, and they said they are partnering with the person one step above them, but if John doesn't say or do anything else, then this is the end of it, and they aren't going to pursue any further corrective action.   </author: Carlyndra>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: pilotavery toEvalutate=true/>\n    From what you've explained, I don't think he's going to last very long.\n   </ author: pilotavery/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

However, none of these people turn on the CC themselves, the just prefer it when it's already on, so I am the only one who switches it on.\n\nA few weeks ago I was on one of my breaks watching TV with CC when John walks up to me and says very firmly, \"Hey Carly, you need to turn the captions off when you're done.\"\n\nMe: \"Why?\"\n\nJohn: \"You're the only person in this store who has problems with their ears, so you need to turn the captions off.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not the only one who is Hard of Hearing in this store, there are other people who needs captions.\" \\(\\(At this time there were two other people who also identified as Hard of Hearing\\)\\)\n\nJohn: \"Oh yeah, who?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not outing people's medical conditions to you.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn the captions off.\"\n\nIt was a very odd interaction.\n\nSomething similar happened the next week, but this time I was sitting with two other people, and the entire time John was telling me that I need to turn off the captions, the other two were telling him that they wanted the captions on, but he absolutely didn't listen to them.\n\nLast week I was clocked out for lunch so I decided to do some shopping. John saw me and called my name, then marched right up to me and very aggressively said \"You **need** to turn the captions off when you're done in the break room.\"\n\nMe: \"That's very [ableist](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism) of you to say, John.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn off the captions.\"\n\nMe: \"John, I'm shopping right now.\"\n\nThen I turned around and walked off to finish getting groceries.\n\nWhen I clocked in this past Monday, I immediately went to HR and told them that I was being intimidated by a coworker because of my disability. They said that they would follow up. I believe they left before they were able to talk to him.\n\nAt my store we announce when we are going to break over our radios so that people know if they need to watch that area. After I announced that I was going on lunch, I went to the break room and saw John's stuff sitting across from where I usually sit \\(by the TV so I can hear better\\), and immediately sat farther away near a coworker.\n\nShe told me that just before I got there John was ranting to a new coworker of ours that I always turn on the captions but that he wasn't going to let me, so he was going to hide the remote.\n\nI looked around and noticed that the remote was indeed missing. I was furious, so I got up to go talk to his immediate supervisor because this is absolutely ridiculous. I passed by John, who was putting something in his locker, and he sneered at me, saying, \"Looking for something, Carly?\"\n\nI didn't respond, but just walked past him and talked to his supervisor, who said he would talk to him. I also told my boss, and wrote down an account of what happened to give to HR.\n\nWhen I went back in to the break room I sat by my coworker again, and was talking with her. John kept trying to make conversation but I purposefully didn't look at him so I couldn't read his lips, but I was able to hear him say \"What, can she not hear me or something?\"\n\nHe sounded genuinely surprised that the Hard of Hearing girl who needs Closed Captioning might not be able to hear him, and even more surprised that I didn't want to talk to him after he purposefully hid the remote from me.\n\nLiterally Closed Captioning is just such an odd thing to be so violently opposed to, and he is probably the most \"Think Hearing\" person I've ever had the displeasure to work with. It's almost impressive how clueless he is.\n\nI had yesterday off, but will be working tonight. I'm curious what HR has to say, if they are there this evening.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I am honestly just astonished by this aggressive behavior.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot to tell you guys the best part of this entire situation! He doesn't even *watch* the TV most of the time. I've seen him turn off the CC or change the channel \\(without asking anyone else in the break room, he'll just grab the remote and change it\\), and then he will sit with his back to the TV and watch videos on his phone with the volume all the way up. He did this once when a *commercial* for American Idol came on, just grabbed the remote and changed the channel. I asked him why he changed the channel without asking and he just said \"I hate American Idol,\" and then turned around and watched videos on his phone, so I don't know what his deal is.  \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/8llwj8/workplace_bully_wont_let_me_have_cc/dzhlae0/) </author: Carlyndra>\n<author: Carlyndra indent=1> Update: I just got home from work.  \n\nI talked to HR again, and they said they were going to talk to John.

I work for a big box retail store. In our break room we have a television. I don't have a smartphone, but everyone else does, so I am typically the only one watching the TV.\n\nI always turn on Closed Captioning so I can understand what's going on, especially since there is a lot  of other noise \\(people talking, watching videos on their phones without headphones, loud box fans because it's hot\\).\n\nThere is an individual, who I'm going to call \"John,\" who hates Closed Captioning for some reason.\n\nI never turn off CC when my break is over.

I was trying to ask if they specifically want open captions only or if something like rear window captioning might be an acceptable alternative but they blocked me before I finished writing the question. \n\nI framed the question by explaining that on-screen captions plus camera movement can trigger my motion sickness, bc I was trying to Illustrate that open captions on all movies always might be more than a preference issue for some ppl, but they might have just assumed I was being stupid or argumentative or trolling. Which is fine. I am indeed stupid a lot and no one has to read my thoughts or answer my questions. \n\nBut I'm more concerned that there's maybe something about my question that was legitimately offensive. I tried googling it, but the only thing seems to be that rear window is prohibitively expensive so maybe that's not accessible if it can't be available equally? Or is open captioning preferred by the Deaf community bc it's very visible and automatic rather than just being an option ppl have to specifically seek out or try to find? Or some other reason? \n\nI genuinely want to learn people's opinions and perspectives. Im totally not passionate about rear window captioning or even movies and television at all. I'm not invested in the answer either way, but I do want to avoid being unintentionally hurtful or dismissive in the future and learn more about the topic in general. </author: iamasecretthrowaway>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: surdophobe toEvalutate=true/>\n    OK first of all rear-window captioning was a film-only thing. It went away about 11 years ago in the digital conversion. So please consider that in your search you are looking at very old data and very old arguments and obsolete restrictions against that data. \n\nBack then the only way for an open captioned movie to exist was to take a physical copy of the movie and use a laser to permanently etch the captions onto the film.  But now, every single theater and every single copy of the movie can be viewed with open captions. It just a matter of the projector operators loading into their equipment that way.  \n\n>I framed the question by explaining that on-screen captions plus camera movement can trigger my motion sickness,\n\nThat's quite a dubious claim, to be honest. I too would assume you were making shit up to be argumentive. \n\n>But I'm more concerned that there's maybe something about my question that was legitimately offensive.\n\nYou are extremely ill-informed about how bad the problem has been for the last 10+ years.  The tech that replaced rear-window captioning has been abysmal.

I was trying to ask if they specifically want open captions only or if something like rear window captioning might be an acceptable alternative but they blocked me before I finished writing the question. \n\nI framed the question by explaining that on-screen captions plus camera movement can trigger my motion sickness, bc I was trying to Illustrate that open captions on all movies always might be more than a preference issue for some ppl, but they might have just assumed I was being stupid or argumentative or trolling. Which is fine. I am indeed stupid a lot and no one has to read my thoughts or answer my questions. \n\nBut I'm more concerned that there's maybe something about my question that was legitimately offensive. I tried googling it, but the only thing seems to be that rear window is prohibitively expensive so maybe that's not accessible if it can't be available equally? Or is open captioning preferred by the Deaf community bc it's very visible and automatic rather than just being an option ppl have to specifically seek out or try to find? Or some other reason? \n\nI genuinely want to learn people's opinions and perspectives. Im totally not passionate about rear window captioning or even movies and television at all. I'm not invested in the answer either way, but I do want to avoid being unintentionally hurtful or dismissive in the future and learn more about the topic in general. </author: iamasecretthrowaway>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: surdophobe toEvalutate=true/>\n    OK first of all rear-window captioning was a film-only thing.

Recently, she did a round of interviews with right-wing media outlets, where she communicated in ASL with interpreters.\n\nHere are couple of interviews:\n\n[BlazeTV Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNSzVw_GX5c)\n\n[The Daily Moth's coverage with another interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bZPlgJ2q-4)\n\nThis caught the attention of the notorious deaf vlogger, Ricky Taylor. \n\nHe spoke about this with some people in the deaf community and someone recognized her. That someone told him her real name. \n\nRicky made a Threads post where he named DataRepublican\u2019s real identity\u2014Jennica Pounds\u2014which set off a firestorm on social media. Jennica responded with the following Twitter post:\n\n>I have been doxxed. Rather than let others control the narrative, I am addressing this directly.\n\n>My name is Jennica Pounds. I recently resigned from my job to pursue DOGE-adjacent efforts full-time. While my background check is still in progress, my ultimate goal is to work with the Administration to cut waste and improve efficiency.\n\n>What began as a side hobby became a mission when I uncovered the role of NGOs in these issues. This is not about left or right. This is about us\u2014the people.\n\n>I gave up everything for this\u2014my safety, my career\u2014because I believe in what I am doing.\n\n>I am 100% Deaf and nonverbal. My lack of signing fluency does not make me any less Deaf. It is a result of a language impairment related to my autism called expressive dysphasia, which affects my ability to construct language fluently in real-time. This impacts my signing, speaking, and even writing, though writing allows me more time to correct mistakes. My interpreter and I spend hours refining my talking points to ensure she conveys what I mean, not just what I say.\n\n>I am Deaf. And being Deaf is not, and should never be, defined by one\u2019s signing ability, particularly when there are medical conditions involved.\n\n>I do not believe the Deaf community should be politically aligned with any party. A priority of mine has always been holding the Administration accountable to Deaf Americans, including advocating for policy changes such as allowing a second interpreter camera stream on television broadcasts. I will continue using my platform to push for these necessary changes.\u201d\n\nHer post triggered a wave of MAGA supporters (mostly hearing people) who brigaded Ricky Taylor\u2019s latest vlog about USAID, posting his home address, descriptions of his house and car, and threats against him\u2014literally doxxing him.\n\nRicky responded in a hilariously defiant way, mocking them. \n\nThen, lo and behold, [Rolling Stone published an article about Jennica Pounds](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/elon-musk-data-republican-anonymous-data-expert-doge-tech-1235280817/). The article referenced a \u201cdeaf man\u201d who named her\u2014obviously referring to Ricky.\n\nThe Rolling Stone article was brutal in its criticism of Jennica\u2019s role in spreading misinformation, which has been used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling key government functions.

Many in the deaf community mocked her signing in the interview videos and even questioned whether she was actually deaf.\n\nIf you know me, you know I despise when people\u2014usually \u201cD\u201d Deaf community members\u2014judge deaf people with below-average ASL skills as \u2018not real Deaf.\u2019\n\nJennica explained that she is a nonverbal autistic deaf person. I\u2019ve met nonverbal autistic deaf people before, and I value them as part of our community. Just because her ASL isn\u2019t fluent or native doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not deaf. I see Jennica as one of us.\n\n#However\u2026\n\nThat said, I have zero sympathy for her role as a data/software engineer being used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling critical government functions that serve and protect disabled people\u2014all of us here.\n\nJennica claims Ricky doxxed her. That\u2019s bullshit. \n\nShe did public interviews showing her face. Yes, she wore sunglasses, but let\u2019s be real\u2014sunglasses aren\u2019t a disguise.\n\nShe was already newsworthy in the deaf community for being a deaf data/software engineer praised by Elon Musk and Charlie Kirk. She boasted about their praise on her website. She also made it publicly known she was joining DOGE.\n\nIt was inevitable that deaf people would start talking and someone would recognize her. Our community is too small for it not to happen.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Rolling Stone\u2019s article. Her endeavors with \"DataRepublicans\" were public enough to attract the attention from a major publication company. They went way deeper in exposing her background. Their criticism of Jennica was completely valid. That article was coming out regardless of Ricky's post. \n\nBy choosing to align herself with this effort, Jennica should have expected public scrutiny.\n\n#In Conclusion\u2026\n\nRicky did nothing wrong by naming her. It was going to happen anyway.\n\nAnd it\u2019s beyond hypocritical for right-wingers to accuse him of doxxing when they literally doxxed Ricky.\n\nSo here we are\u2014a deaf person in our community has aligned herself with an administration that is actively working against us. </author: HelensScarletFever>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: killerbrain toEvalutate=true/>\n    You said it well. It's extremely sad and pathetic that Jennica is assisting the same people working to destroy all the services she benefited from. She should not be attacked for her signing skills.

Recently, she did a round of interviews with right-wing media outlets, where she communicated in ASL with interpreters.\n\nHere are couple of interviews:\n\n[BlazeTV Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNSzVw_GX5c)\n\n[The Daily Moth's coverage with another interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bZPlgJ2q-4)\n\nThis caught the attention of the notorious deaf vlogger, Ricky Taylor. \n\nHe spoke about this with some people in the deaf community and someone recognized her. That someone told him her real name. \n\nRicky made a Threads post where he named DataRepublican\u2019s real identity\u2014Jennica Pounds\u2014which set off a firestorm on social media. Jennica responded with the following Twitter post:\n\n>I have been doxxed. Rather than let others control the narrative, I am addressing this directly.\n\n>My name is Jennica Pounds.

That\u2019s bullshit. \n\nShe did public interviews showing her face. Yes, she wore sunglasses, but let\u2019s be real\u2014sunglasses aren\u2019t a disguise.\n\nShe was already newsworthy in the deaf community for being a deaf data/software engineer praised by Elon Musk and Charlie Kirk. She boasted about their praise on her website. She also made it publicly known she was joining DOGE.\n\nIt was inevitable that deaf people would start talking and someone would recognize her. Our community is too small for it not to happen.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Rolling Stone\u2019s article. Her endeavors with \"DataRepublicans\" were public enough to attract the attention from a major publication company. They went way deeper in exposing her background. Their criticism of Jennica was completely valid. That article was coming out regardless of Ricky's post. \n\nBy choosing to align herself with this effort, Jennica should have expected public scrutiny.\n\n#In Conclusion\u2026\n\nRicky did nothing wrong by naming her. It was going to happen anyway.\n\nAnd it\u2019s beyond hypocritical for right-wingers to accuse him of doxxing when they literally doxxed Ricky.\n\nSo here we are\u2014a deaf person in our community has aligned herself with an administration that is actively working against us. </author: HelensScarletFever>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: killerbrain toEvalutate=true/>\n    You said it well. It's extremely sad and pathetic that Jennica is assisting the same people working to destroy all the services she benefited from. She should not be attacked for her signing skills. She SHOULD be attacked for selling her community out. She, too, will find herself as fucked as the rest of us when she's no longer useful to this group.\n   </ author: killerbrain/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s an app I can download for my phone. I\u2019m going to the movies next week. I don\u2019t go often and I really don\u2019t want to have to ask for the closed caption device. TIA!  </author: alittlefaith530>\n<author: Kuildeous indent=1> Why not the closed caption device? Is it the fear of battery power? I had that situation with one theatre where twice the device ran out of juice. I suspect that it's negligent employees not fully charging them, but the owner said that he would investigate. Sometimes batteries go bad, so maybe he needs to replace them. \n\nI would be curious about a phone app because there's very little I can imagine that wouldn't intrude on other people's viewing pleasure, unlike the closed caption devices. \n\nAlso, caption algorithms have a long ways to go, so I would only trust professionally transcribed captions. \n\nI may check out Live Transcribe for those older movies that don't have captions loaded. </author: Kuildeous>\n<author: alittlefaith530 indent=2> That is a very good point about the phone. \n\nIt\u2019s fear of taking it away from someone who might need it more than I do. I have moderate/severe (almost profound) loss but only in one ear. I can and have managed, but for this movie I would prefer to get all of the dialog. The device would greatly help me but I wouldn\u2019t want to take it from someone who needs it more than I do. </author: alittlefaith530>\n<author: Kuildeous indent=3> That's considerate of you. From my experience, I haven't see these caption devices run out. I suppose it could be worth waiting until 5 minutes before the movie and then check in with them if they have one available. \n\nBut hearing loss is hearing loss. If you need captions to fully understand the movie, I don't think we can really say you're less deserving of this assistance than others. \n\nEspecially since movies nowadays are so freakin' loud that dialogue gets swallowed up more often than not. \n\nI've seen some theatres offer open captions for select viewings. I may have to give that a try. Still not a common occurrence, so good luck finding one of those. </author: Kuildeous>\n<author: alittlefaith530 indent=4> Thank you. That means a lot to me.

The problem with OIC Movies is that most of their videos are not publicly available and not all of the videos have captions. I hope there are public ASL talks in the form of TED talks with accurate translations. Any pointers on such collections of videos? </author: Zia_0216>\n<author: [deleted] indent=1> If you want TED Talks by deaf people, this playlist has a lot. Some are by signers, and some are not. I see some that seem to be by hearing people talking about deaf people (like technology for the deaf/hoh). \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA17E58E99C442771 \n\nIf those aren\u2019t to your satisfaction, let us know what else you\u2019re looking for, so we can find better videos. I also enjoy Melmira, which is a show that\u2019s more focused on human stories and lifestyles, so it\u2019s more interview-heavy, but interesting to me.

I think I\u2019ll spend a lot of time on them. I\u2019m probably asking for too much. Do you know where I can find more videos that have only one narrators / signers sitting in the center?

They\u2019re just used to mumbling to each other across the room and can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like not being able to hear it. And then you feel disheartened and tired asking repeatedly.

I work for a big box retail store. In our break room we have a television. I don't have a smartphone, but everyone else does, so I am typically the only one watching the TV.\n\nI always turn on Closed Captioning so I can understand what's going on, especially since there is a lot  of other noise \\(people talking, watching videos on their phones without headphones, loud box fans because it's hot\\).\n\nThere is an individual, who I'm going to call \"John,\" who hates Closed Captioning for some reason.\n\nI never turn off CC when my break is over. Other people I work with have told me that they prefer it on because some of them also have hearing problems \\(but don't identify as Hard of Hearing\\), or they sit far away from the TV and can't hear it from where they are, or just because it helps them focus on what's happening. However, none of these people turn on the CC themselves, the just prefer it when it's already on, so I am the only one who switches it on.\n\nA few weeks ago I was on one of my breaks watching TV with CC when John walks up to me and says very firmly, \"Hey Carly, you need to turn the captions off when you're done.\"\n\nMe: \"Why?\"\n\nJohn: \"You're the only person in this store who has problems with their ears, so you need to turn the captions off.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not the only one who is Hard of Hearing in this store, there are other people who needs captions.\" \\(\\(At this time there were two other people who also identified as Hard of Hearing\\)\\)\n\nJohn: \"Oh yeah, who?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not outing people's medical conditions to you.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn the captions off.\"\n\nIt was a very odd interaction.\n\nSomething similar happened the next week, but this time I was sitting with two other people, and the entire time John was telling me that I need to turn off the captions, the other two were telling him that they wanted the captions on, but he absolutely didn't listen to them.\n\nLast week I was clocked out for lunch so I decided to do some shopping. John saw me and called my name, then marched right up to me and very aggressively said \"You **need** to turn the captions off when you're done in the break room.\"\n\nMe: \"That's very [ableist](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism) of you to say, John.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn off the captions.\"\n\nMe: \"John, I'm shopping right now.\"\n\nThen I turned around and walked off to finish getting groceries.\n\nWhen I clocked in this past Monday, I immediately went to HR and told them that I was being intimidated by a coworker because of my disability. They said that they would follow up. I believe they left before they were able to talk to him.\n\nAt my store we announce when we are going to break over our radios so that people know if they need to watch that area. After I announced that I was going on lunch, I went to the break room and saw John's stuff sitting across from where I usually sit \\(by the TV so I can hear better\\), and immediately sat farther away near a coworker.\n\nShe told me that just before I got there John was ranting to a new coworker of ours that I always turn on the captions but that he wasn't going to let me, so he was going to hide the remote.\n\nI looked around and noticed that the remote was indeed missing. I was furious, so I got up to go talk to his immediate supervisor because this is absolutely ridiculous. I passed by John, who was putting something in his locker, and he sneered at me, saying, \"Looking for something, Carly?\"\n\nI didn't respond, but just walked past him and talked to his supervisor, who said he would talk to him. I also told my boss, and wrote down an account of what happened to give to HR.\n\nWhen I went back in to the break room I sat by my coworker again, and was talking with her. John kept trying to make conversation but I purposefully didn't look at him so I couldn't read his lips, but I was able to hear him say \"What, can she not hear me or something?\"\n\nHe sounded genuinely surprised that the Hard of Hearing girl who needs Closed Captioning might not be able to hear him, and even more surprised that I didn't want to talk to him after he purposefully hid the remote from me.\n\nLiterally Closed Captioning is just such an odd thing to be so violently opposed to, and he is probably the most \"Think Hearing\" person I've ever had the displeasure to work with. It's almost impressive how clueless he is.\n\nI had yesterday off, but will be working tonight. I'm curious what HR has to say, if they are there this evening.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I am honestly just astonished by this aggressive behavior.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot to tell you guys the best part of this entire situation! He doesn't even *watch* the TV most of the time. I've seen him turn off the CC or change the channel \\(without asking anyone else in the break room, he'll just grab the remote and change it\\), and then he will sit with his back to the TV and watch videos on his phone with the volume all the way up.

I work for a big box retail store. In our break room we have a television. I don't have a smartphone, but everyone else does, so I am typically the only one watching the TV.\n\nI always turn on Closed Captioning so I can understand what's going on, especially since there is a lot  of other noise \\(people talking, watching videos on their phones without headphones, loud box fans because it's hot\\).\n\nThere is an individual, who I'm going to call \"John,\" who hates Closed Captioning for some reason.\n\nI never turn off CC when my break is over. Other people I work with have told me that they prefer it on because some of them also have hearing problems \\(but don't identify as Hard of Hearing\\), or they sit far away from the TV and can't hear it from where they are, or just because it helps them focus on what's happening. However, none of these people turn on the CC themselves, the just prefer it when it's already on, so I am the only one who switches it on.\n\nA few weeks ago I was on one of my breaks watching TV with CC when John walks up to me and says very firmly, \"Hey Carly, you need to turn the captions off when you're done.\"\n\nMe: \"Why?\"\n\nJohn: \"You're the only person in this store who has problems with their ears, so you need to turn the captions off.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not the only one who is Hard of Hearing in this store, there are other people who needs captions.\" \\(\\(At this time there were two other people who also identified as Hard of Hearing\\)\\)\n\nJohn: \"Oh yeah, who?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not outing people's medical conditions to you.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn the captions off.\"\n\nIt was a very odd interaction.\n\nSomething similar happened the next week, but this time I was sitting with two other people, and the entire time John was telling me that I need to turn off the captions, the other two were telling him that they wanted the captions on, but he absolutely didn't listen to them.\n\nLast week I was clocked out for lunch so I decided to do some shopping. John saw me and called my name, then marched right up to me and very aggressively said \"You **need** to turn the captions off when you're done in the break room.\"\n\nMe: \"That's very [ableist](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism) of you to say, John.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn off the captions.\"\n\nMe: \"John, I'm shopping right now.\"\n\nThen I turned around and walked off to finish getting groceries.\n\nWhen I clocked in this past Monday, I immediately went to HR and told them that I was being intimidated by a coworker because of my disability. They said that they would follow up. I believe they left before they were able to talk to him.\n\nAt my store we announce when we are going to break over our radios so that people know if they need to watch that area. After I announced that I was going on lunch, I went to the break room and saw John's stuff sitting across from where I usually sit \\(by the TV so I can hear better\\), and immediately sat farther away near a coworker.\n\nShe told me that just before I got there John was ranting to a new coworker of ours that I always turn on the captions but that he wasn't going to let me, so he was going to hide the remote.\n\nI looked around and noticed that the remote was indeed missing. I was furious, so I got up to go talk to his immediate supervisor because this is absolutely ridiculous. I passed by John, who was putting something in his locker, and he sneered at me, saying, \"Looking for something, Carly?\"\n\nI didn't respond, but just walked past him and talked to his supervisor, who said he would talk to him. I also told my boss, and wrote down an account of what happened to give to HR.\n\nWhen I went back in to the break room I sat by my coworker again, and was talking with her. John kept trying to make conversation but I purposefully didn't look at him so I couldn't read his lips, but I was able to hear him say \"What, can she not hear me or something?\"\n\nHe sounded genuinely surprised that the Hard of Hearing girl who needs Closed Captioning might not be able to hear him, and even more surprised that I didn't want to talk to him after he purposefully hid the remote from me.\n\nLiterally Closed Captioning is just such an odd thing to be so violently opposed to, and he is probably the most \"Think Hearing\" person I've ever had the displeasure to work with. It's almost impressive how clueless he is.\n\nI had yesterday off, but will be working tonight. I'm curious what HR has to say, if they are there this evening.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I am honestly just astonished by this aggressive behavior.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot to tell you guys the best part of this entire situation! He doesn't even *watch* the TV most of the time. I've seen him turn off the CC or change the channel \\(without asking anyone else in the break room, he'll just grab the remote and change it\\), and then he will sit with his back to the TV and watch videos on his phone with the volume all the way up. He did this once when a *commercial* for American Idol came on, just grabbed the remote and changed the channel. I asked him why he changed the channel without asking and he just said \"I hate American Idol,\" and then turned around and watched videos on his phone, so I don't know what his deal is.  \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/8llwj8/workplace_bully_wont_let_me_have_cc/dzhlae0/) </author: Carlyndra>\n<author: Carlyndra indent=1> Update: I just got home from work.  \n\nI talked to HR again, and they said they were going to talk to John.

I was trying to ask if they specifically want open captions only or if something like rear window captioning might be an acceptable alternative but they blocked me before I finished writing the question. \n\nI framed the question by explaining that on-screen captions plus camera movement can trigger my motion sickness, bc I was trying to Illustrate that open captions on all movies always might be more than a preference issue for some ppl, but they might have just assumed I was being stupid or argumentative or trolling. Which is fine. I am indeed stupid a lot and no one has to read my thoughts or answer my questions. \n\nBut I'm more concerned that there's maybe something about my question that was legitimately offensive. I tried googling it, but the only thing seems to be that rear window is prohibitively expensive so maybe that's not accessible if it can't be available equally? Or is open captioning preferred by the Deaf community bc it's very visible and automatic rather than just being an option ppl have to specifically seek out or try to find? Or some other reason? \n\nI genuinely want to learn people's opinions and perspectives. Im totally not passionate about rear window captioning or even movies and television at all. I'm not invested in the answer either way, but I do want to avoid being unintentionally hurtful or dismissive in the future and learn more about the topic in general. </author: iamasecretthrowaway>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: surdophobe toEvalutate=true/>\n    OK first of all rear-window captioning was a film-only thing.

Recently, she did a round of interviews with right-wing media outlets, where she communicated in ASL with interpreters.\n\nHere are couple of interviews:\n\n[BlazeTV Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNSzVw_GX5c)\n\n[The Daily Moth's coverage with another interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bZPlgJ2q-4)\n\nThis caught the attention of the notorious deaf vlogger, Ricky Taylor. \n\nHe spoke about this with some people in the deaf community and someone recognized her. That someone told him her real name. \n\nRicky made a Threads post where he named DataRepublican\u2019s real identity\u2014Jennica Pounds\u2014which set off a firestorm on social media. Jennica responded with the following Twitter post:\n\n>I have been doxxed. Rather than let others control the narrative, I am addressing this directly.\n\n>My name is Jennica Pounds. I recently resigned from my job to pursue DOGE-adjacent efforts full-time. While my background check is still in progress, my ultimate goal is to work with the Administration to cut waste and improve efficiency.\n\n>What began as a side hobby became a mission when I uncovered the role of NGOs in these issues. This is not about left or right. This is about us\u2014the people.\n\n>I gave up everything for this\u2014my safety, my career\u2014because I believe in what I am doing.\n\n>I am 100% Deaf and nonverbal. My lack of signing fluency does not make me any less Deaf. It is a result of a language impairment related to my autism called expressive dysphasia, which affects my ability to construct language fluently in real-time. This impacts my signing, speaking, and even writing, though writing allows me more time to correct mistakes. My interpreter and I spend hours refining my talking points to ensure she conveys what I mean, not just what I say.\n\n>I am Deaf. And being Deaf is not, and should never be, defined by one\u2019s signing ability, particularly when there are medical conditions involved.\n\n>I do not believe the Deaf community should be politically aligned with any party. A priority of mine has always been holding the Administration accountable to Deaf Americans, including advocating for policy changes such as allowing a second interpreter camera stream on television broadcasts. I will continue using my platform to push for these necessary changes.\u201d\n\nHer post triggered a wave of MAGA supporters (mostly hearing people) who brigaded Ricky Taylor\u2019s latest vlog about USAID, posting his home address, descriptions of his house and car, and threats against him\u2014literally doxxing him.\n\nRicky responded in a hilariously defiant way, mocking them. \n\nThen, lo and behold, [Rolling Stone published an article about Jennica Pounds](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/elon-musk-data-republican-anonymous-data-expert-doge-tech-1235280817/). The article referenced a \u201cdeaf man\u201d who named her\u2014obviously referring to Ricky.\n\nThe Rolling Stone article was brutal in its criticism of Jennica\u2019s role in spreading misinformation, which has been used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling key government functions. It also revealed details about her husband, home, distillery business, employment history, and a company she registered in Utah. Basically, it was a takedown piece.\n\nFYI - I heard Rolling Stone had been working on this article for a while, intending to be the first to expose Jennica\u2019s identity\u2014but Ricky beat them to it. That led to Rolling Stone reaching out to Ricky before publication, hence the vague reference to a \u201cdeaf man\u201d who named her.\n\nAlso the timing of this post is really perfect because today [The New York Times published a full list of DOGE staffers](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/27/us/politics/doge-staff-list.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare). \n\nMAGA supporters are now crying about doxxing\u2014the same way they did when Ricky exposed Jennica. But there\u2019s plenty of online discussion about how these people are on the government payroll, impacting American citizens, meaning their identities should be public.\n\n#My Take on This Drama\n\n***My Sympathy for Jennica***\n\nFirst, I want to address the backlash Jennica faced over her ASL skills. Many in the deaf community mocked her signing in the interview videos and even questioned whether she was actually deaf.\n\nIf you know me, you know I despise when people\u2014usually \u201cD\u201d Deaf community members\u2014judge deaf people with below-average ASL skills as \u2018not real Deaf.\u2019\n\nJennica explained that she is a nonverbal autistic deaf person. I\u2019ve met nonverbal autistic deaf people before, and I value them as part of our community. Just because her ASL isn\u2019t fluent or native doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not deaf. I see Jennica as one of us.\n\n#However\u2026\n\nThat said, I have zero sympathy for her role as a data/software engineer being used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling critical government functions that serve and protect disabled people\u2014all of us here.\n\nJennica claims Ricky doxxed her. That\u2019s bullshit. \n\nShe did public interviews showing her face. Yes, she wore sunglasses, but let\u2019s be real\u2014sunglasses aren\u2019t a disguise.\n\nShe was already newsworthy in the deaf community for being a deaf data/software engineer praised by Elon Musk and Charlie Kirk. She boasted about their praise on her website. She also made it publicly known she was joining DOGE.\n\nIt was inevitable that deaf people would start talking and someone would recognize her. Our community is too small for it not to happen.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Rolling Stone\u2019s article. Her endeavors with \"DataRepublicans\" were public enough to attract the attention from a major publication company. They went way deeper in exposing her background. Their criticism of Jennica was completely valid. That article was coming out regardless of Ricky's post. \n\nBy choosing to align herself with this effort, Jennica should have expected public scrutiny.\n\n#In Conclusion\u2026\n\nRicky did nothing wrong by naming her. It was going to happen anyway.\n\nAnd it\u2019s beyond hypocritical for right-wingers to accuse him of doxxing when they literally doxxed Ricky.\n\nSo here we are\u2014a deaf person in our community has aligned herself with an administration that is actively working against us. </author: HelensScarletFever>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: killerbrain toEvalutate=true/>\n    You said it well. It's extremely sad and pathetic that Jennica is assisting the same people working to destroy all the services she benefited from. She should not be attacked for her signing skills. She SHOULD be attacked for selling her community out. She, too, will find herself as fucked as the rest of us when she's no longer useful to this group.\n   </ author: killerbrain/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

Recently, she did a round of interviews with right-wing media outlets, where she communicated in ASL with interpreters.\n\nHere are couple of interviews:\n\n[BlazeTV Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNSzVw_GX5c)\n\n[The Daily Moth's coverage with another interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bZPlgJ2q-4)\n\nThis caught the attention of the notorious deaf vlogger, Ricky Taylor. \n\nHe spoke about this with some people in the deaf community and someone recognized her. That someone told him her real name. \n\nRicky made a Threads post where he named DataRepublican\u2019s real identity\u2014Jennica Pounds\u2014which set off a firestorm on social media. Jennica responded with the following Twitter post:\n\n>I have been doxxed. Rather than let others control the narrative, I am addressing this directly.\n\n>My name is Jennica Pounds. I recently resigned from my job to pursue DOGE-adjacent efforts full-time. While my background check is still in progress, my ultimate goal is to work with the Administration to cut waste and improve efficiency.\n\n>What began as a side hobby became a mission when I uncovered the role of NGOs in these issues. This is not about left or right. This is about us\u2014the people.\n\n>I gave up everything for this\u2014my safety, my career\u2014because I believe in what I am doing.\n\n>I am 100% Deaf and nonverbal. My lack of signing fluency does not make me any less Deaf. It is a result of a language impairment related to my autism called expressive dysphasia, which affects my ability to construct language fluently in real-time. This impacts my signing, speaking, and even writing, though writing allows me more time to correct mistakes. My interpreter and I spend hours refining my talking points to ensure she conveys what I mean, not just what I say.\n\n>I am Deaf. And being Deaf is not, and should never be, defined by one\u2019s signing ability, particularly when there are medical conditions involved.\n\n>I do not believe the Deaf community should be politically aligned with any party. A priority of mine has always been holding the Administration accountable to Deaf Americans, including advocating for policy changes such as allowing a second interpreter camera stream on television broadcasts. I will continue using my platform to push for these necessary changes.\u201d\n\nHer post triggered a wave of MAGA supporters (mostly hearing people) who brigaded Ricky Taylor\u2019s latest vlog about USAID, posting his home address, descriptions of his house and car, and threats against him\u2014literally doxxing him.\n\nRicky responded in a hilariously defiant way, mocking them. \n\nThen, lo and behold, [Rolling Stone published an article about Jennica Pounds](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/elon-musk-data-republican-anonymous-data-expert-doge-tech-1235280817/). The article referenced a \u201cdeaf man\u201d who named her\u2014obviously referring to Ricky.\n\nThe Rolling Stone article was brutal in its criticism of Jennica\u2019s role in spreading misinformation, which has been used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling key government functions. It also revealed details about her husband, home, distillery business, employment history, and a company she registered in Utah. Basically, it was a takedown piece.\n\nFYI - I heard Rolling Stone had been working on this article for a while, intending to be the first to expose Jennica\u2019s identity\u2014but Ricky beat them to it. That led to Rolling Stone reaching out to Ricky before publication, hence the vague reference to a \u201cdeaf man\u201d who named her.\n\nAlso the timing of this post is really perfect because today [The New York Times published a full list of DOGE staffers](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/27/us/politics/doge-staff-list.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare). \n\nMAGA supporters are now crying about doxxing\u2014the same way they did when Ricky exposed Jennica. But there\u2019s plenty of online discussion about how these people are on the government payroll, impacting American citizens, meaning their identities should be public.\n\n#My Take on This Drama\n\n***My Sympathy for Jennica***\n\nFirst, I want to address the backlash Jennica faced over her ASL skills. Many in the deaf community mocked her signing in the interview videos and even questioned whether she was actually deaf.\n\nIf you know me, you know I despise when people\u2014usually \u201cD\u201d Deaf community members\u2014judge deaf people with below-average ASL skills as \u2018not real Deaf.\u2019\n\nJennica explained that she is a nonverbal autistic deaf person. I\u2019ve met nonverbal autistic deaf people before, and I value them as part of our community. Just because her ASL isn\u2019t fluent or native doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not deaf. I see Jennica as one of us.\n\n#However\u2026\n\nThat said, I have zero sympathy for her role as a data/software engineer being used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling critical government functions that serve and protect disabled people\u2014all of us here.\n\nJennica claims Ricky doxxed her. That\u2019s bullshit. \n\nShe did public interviews showing her face. Yes, she wore sunglasses, but let\u2019s be real\u2014sunglasses aren\u2019t a disguise.\n\nShe was already newsworthy in the deaf community for being a deaf data/software engineer praised by Elon Musk and Charlie Kirk. She boasted about their praise on her website. She also made it publicly known she was joining DOGE.\n\nIt was inevitable that deaf people would start talking and someone would recognize her. Our community is too small for it not to happen.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Rolling Stone\u2019s article. Her endeavors with \"DataRepublicans\" were public enough to attract the attention from a major publication company. They went way deeper in exposing her background. Their criticism of Jennica was completely valid. That article was coming out regardless of Ricky's post. \n\nBy choosing to align herself with this effort, Jennica should have expected public scrutiny.\n\n#In Conclusion\u2026\n\nRicky did nothing wrong by naming her. It was going to happen anyway.\n\nAnd it\u2019s beyond hypocritical for right-wingers to accuse him of doxxing when they literally doxxed Ricky.\n\nSo here we are\u2014a deaf person in our community has aligned herself with an administration that is actively working against us. </author: HelensScarletFever>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: killerbrain toEvalutate=true/>\n    You said it well. It's extremely sad and pathetic that Jennica is assisting the same people working to destroy all the services she benefited from. She should not be attacked for her signing skills. She SHOULD be attacked for selling her community out. She, too, will find herself as fucked as the rest of us when she's no longer useful to this group.\n   </ author: killerbrain/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s an app I can download for my phone. I\u2019m going to the movies next week. I don\u2019t go often and I really don\u2019t want to have to ask for the closed caption device. TIA!  </author: alittlefaith530>\n<author: Kuildeous indent=1> Why not the closed caption device? Is it the fear of battery power? I had that situation with one theatre where twice the device ran out of juice. I suspect that it's negligent employees not fully charging them, but the owner said that he would investigate. Sometimes batteries go bad, so maybe he needs to replace them. \n\nI would be curious about a phone app because there's very little I can imagine that wouldn't intrude on other people's viewing pleasure, unlike the closed caption devices. \n\nAlso, caption algorithms have a long ways to go, so I would only trust professionally transcribed captions. \n\nI may check out Live Transcribe for those older movies that don't have captions loaded. </author: Kuildeous>\n<author: alittlefaith530 indent=2> That is a very good point about the phone. \n\nIt\u2019s fear of taking it away from someone who might need it more than I do. I have moderate/severe (almost profound) loss but only in one ear. I can and have managed, but for this movie I would prefer to get all of the dialog. The device would greatly help me but I wouldn\u2019t want to take it from someone who needs it more than I do. </author: alittlefaith530>\n<author: Kuildeous indent=3> That's considerate of you. From my experience, I haven't see these caption devices run out. I suppose it could be worth waiting until 5 minutes before the movie and then check in with them if they have one available. \n\nBut hearing loss is hearing loss. If you need captions to fully understand the movie, I don't think we can really say you're less deserving of this assistance than others. \n\nEspecially since movies nowadays are so freakin' loud that dialogue gets swallowed up more often than not. \n\nI've seen some theatres offer open captions for select viewings. I may have to give that a try. Still not a common occurrence, so good luck finding one of those. </author: Kuildeous>\n<author: alittlefaith530 indent=4> Thank you. That means a lot to me. Sometimes I don\u2019t feel deserving. \n\nOh yeah movies now are so hard. I\u2019m going to see the new Deadpool and they talk to fast in those movies. </author: alittlefaith530>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: Kuildeous toEvalutate=true/>\n    Ugh.

My name is Chris and I have had high frequency hearing loss all of my life, since birth. I am a software developer and this is an iPhone app I developed that generates live transcriptions allowing you to see captions of speech, then save them as transcripts, and then print, email, or text the transcripts. This is a beta version, but it is free to download and use from the\u00a0[apple app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/livecaptionsai/id6464103487). All feedback is welcome! </author: GreenblattInvestor>\n<author: peachyqueen_7 indent=1> This is awesome!

I work for a big box retail store. In our break room we have a television. I don't have a smartphone, but everyone else does, so I am typically the only one watching the TV.\n\nI always turn on Closed Captioning so I can understand what's going on, especially since there is a lot  of other noise \\(people talking, watching videos on their phones without headphones, loud box fans because it's hot\\).\n\nThere is an individual, who I'm going to call \"John,\" who hates Closed Captioning for some reason.\n\nI never turn off CC when my break is over. Other people I work with have told me that they prefer it on because some of them also have hearing problems \\(but don't identify as Hard of Hearing\\), or they sit far away from the TV and can't hear it from where they are, or just because it helps them focus on what's happening. However, none of these people turn on the CC themselves, the just prefer it when it's already on, so I am the only one who switches it on.\n\nA few weeks ago I was on one of my breaks watching TV with CC when John walks up to me and says very firmly, \"Hey Carly, you need to turn the captions off when you're done.\"\n\nMe: \"Why?\"\n\nJohn: \"You're the only person in this store who has problems with their ears, so you need to turn the captions off.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not the only one who is Hard of Hearing in this store, there are other people who needs captions.\" \\(\\(At this time there were two other people who also identified as Hard of Hearing\\)\\)\n\nJohn: \"Oh yeah, who?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not outing people's medical conditions to you.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn the captions off.\"\n\nIt was a very odd interaction.\n\nSomething similar happened the next week, but this time I was sitting with two other people, and the entire time John was telling me that I need to turn off the captions, the other two were telling him that they wanted the captions on, but he absolutely didn't listen to them.\n\nLast week I was clocked out for lunch so I decided to do some shopping. John saw me and called my name, then marched right up to me and very aggressively said \"You **need** to turn the captions off when you're done in the break room.\"\n\nMe: \"That's very [ableist](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism) of you to say, John.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn off the captions.\"\n\nMe: \"John, I'm shopping right now.\"\n\nThen I turned around and walked off to finish getting groceries.\n\nWhen I clocked in this past Monday, I immediately went to HR and told them that I was being intimidated by a coworker because of my disability. They said that they would follow up. I believe they left before they were able to talk to him.\n\nAt my store we announce when we are going to break over our radios so that people know if they need to watch that area. After I announced that I was going on lunch, I went to the break room and saw John's stuff sitting across from where I usually sit \\(by the TV so I can hear better\\), and immediately sat farther away near a coworker.\n\nShe told me that just before I got there John was ranting to a new coworker of ours that I always turn on the captions but that he wasn't going to let me, so he was going to hide the remote.\n\nI looked around and noticed that the remote was indeed missing. I was furious, so I got up to go talk to his immediate supervisor because this is absolutely ridiculous. I passed by John, who was putting something in his locker, and he sneered at me, saying, \"Looking for something, Carly?\"\n\nI didn't respond, but just walked past him and talked to his supervisor, who said he would talk to him. I also told my boss, and wrote down an account of what happened to give to HR.\n\nWhen I went back in to the break room I sat by my coworker again, and was talking with her. John kept trying to make conversation but I purposefully didn't look at him so I couldn't read his lips, but I was able to hear him say \"What, can she not hear me or something?\"\n\nHe sounded genuinely surprised that the Hard of Hearing girl who needs Closed Captioning might not be able to hear him, and even more surprised that I didn't want to talk to him after he purposefully hid the remote from me.\n\nLiterally Closed Captioning is just such an odd thing to be so violently opposed to, and he is probably the most \"Think Hearing\" person I've ever had the displeasure to work with. It's almost impressive how clueless he is.\n\nI had yesterday off, but will be working tonight. I'm curious what HR has to say, if they are there this evening.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I am honestly just astonished by this aggressive behavior.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot to tell you guys the best part of this entire situation! He doesn't even *watch* the TV most of the time. I've seen him turn off the CC or change the channel \\(without asking anyone else in the break room, he'll just grab the remote and change it\\), and then he will sit with his back to the TV and watch videos on his phone with the volume all the way up. He did this once when a *commercial* for American Idol came on, just grabbed the remote and changed the channel. I asked him why he changed the channel without asking and he just said \"I hate American Idol,\" and then turned around and watched videos on his phone, so I don't know what his deal is.  \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/8llwj8/workplace_bully_wont_let_me_have_cc/dzhlae0/) </author: Carlyndra>\n<author: Carlyndra indent=1> Update: I just got home from work.  \n\nI talked to HR again, and they said they were going to talk to John.

I work for a big box retail store. In our break room we have a television. I don't have a smartphone, but everyone else does, so I am typically the only one watching the TV.\n\nI always turn on Closed Captioning so I can understand what's going on, especially since there is a lot  of other noise \\(people talking, watching videos on their phones without headphones, loud box fans because it's hot\\).\n\nThere is an individual, who I'm going to call \"John,\" who hates Closed Captioning for some reason.\n\nI never turn off CC when my break is over.

I asked him why he changed the channel without asking and he just said \"I hate American Idol,\" and then turned around and watched videos on his phone, so I don't know what his deal is.  \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/8llwj8/workplace_bully_wont_let_me_have_cc/dzhlae0/) </author: Carlyndra>\n<author: Carlyndra indent=1> Update: I just got home from work.  \n\nI talked to HR again, and they said they were going to talk to John.

I was trying to ask if they specifically want open captions only or if something like rear window captioning might be an acceptable alternative but they blocked me before I finished writing the question. \n\nI framed the question by explaining that on-screen captions plus camera movement can trigger my motion sickness, bc I was trying to Illustrate that open captions on all movies always might be more than a preference issue for some ppl, but they might have just assumed I was being stupid or argumentative or trolling. Which is fine. I am indeed stupid a lot and no one has to read my thoughts or answer my questions. \n\nBut I'm more concerned that there's maybe something about my question that was legitimately offensive. I tried googling it, but the only thing seems to be that rear window is prohibitively expensive so maybe that's not accessible if it can't be available equally? Or is open captioning preferred by the Deaf community bc it's very visible and automatic rather than just being an option ppl have to specifically seek out or try to find? Or some other reason? \n\nI genuinely want to learn people's opinions and perspectives. Im totally not passionate about rear window captioning or even movies and television at all.

There's no longer the excuse of scarcity or expense from the movie theaters. \n\n>Im totally not passionate about rear window captioning\n\nI find this to be doubtful as well, you keep using terminology for tech that has not existed for over a decade.  If you were passionate at all you would have read up on the history of this issue and hopefully have realized how little you currently know about all this.\n   </ author: surdophobe/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

Recently, she did a round of interviews with right-wing media outlets, where she communicated in ASL with interpreters.\n\nHere are couple of interviews:\n\n[BlazeTV Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNSzVw_GX5c)\n\n[The Daily Moth's coverage with another interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bZPlgJ2q-4)\n\nThis caught the attention of the notorious deaf vlogger, Ricky Taylor. \n\nHe spoke about this with some people in the deaf community and someone recognized her. That someone told him her real name. \n\nRicky made a Threads post where he named DataRepublican\u2019s real identity\u2014Jennica Pounds\u2014which set off a firestorm on social media. Jennica responded with the following Twitter post:\n\n>I have been doxxed. Rather than let others control the narrative, I am addressing this directly.\n\n>My name is Jennica Pounds. I recently resigned from my job to pursue DOGE-adjacent efforts full-time. While my background check is still in progress, my ultimate goal is to work with the Administration to cut waste and improve efficiency.\n\n>What began as a side hobby became a mission when I uncovered the role of NGOs in these issues. This is not about left or right. This is about us\u2014the people.\n\n>I gave up everything for this\u2014my safety, my career\u2014because I believe in what I am doing.\n\n>I am 100% Deaf and nonverbal. My lack of signing fluency does not make me any less Deaf. It is a result of a language impairment related to my autism called expressive dysphasia, which affects my ability to construct language fluently in real-time. This impacts my signing, speaking, and even writing, though writing allows me more time to correct mistakes. My interpreter and I spend hours refining my talking points to ensure she conveys what I mean, not just what I say.\n\n>I am Deaf. And being Deaf is not, and should never be, defined by one\u2019s signing ability, particularly when there are medical conditions involved.\n\n>I do not believe the Deaf community should be politically aligned with any party. A priority of mine has always been holding the Administration accountable to Deaf Americans, including advocating for policy changes such as allowing a second interpreter camera stream on television broadcasts. I will continue using my platform to push for these necessary changes.\u201d\n\nHer post triggered a wave of MAGA supporters (mostly hearing people) who brigaded Ricky Taylor\u2019s latest vlog about USAID, posting his home address, descriptions of his house and car, and threats against him\u2014literally doxxing him.\n\nRicky responded in a hilariously defiant way, mocking them. \n\nThen, lo and behold, [Rolling Stone published an article about Jennica Pounds](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/elon-musk-data-republican-anonymous-data-expert-doge-tech-1235280817/). The article referenced a \u201cdeaf man\u201d who named her\u2014obviously referring to Ricky.\n\nThe Rolling Stone article was brutal in its criticism of Jennica\u2019s role in spreading misinformation, which has been used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling key government functions. It also revealed details about her husband, home, distillery business, employment history, and a company she registered in Utah. Basically, it was a takedown piece.\n\nFYI - I heard Rolling Stone had been working on this article for a while, intending to be the first to expose Jennica\u2019s identity\u2014but Ricky beat them to it. That led to Rolling Stone reaching out to Ricky before publication, hence the vague reference to a \u201cdeaf man\u201d who named her.\n\nAlso the timing of this post is really perfect because today [The New York Times published a full list of DOGE staffers](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/27/us/politics/doge-staff-list.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare). \n\nMAGA supporters are now crying about doxxing\u2014the same way they did when Ricky exposed Jennica. But there\u2019s plenty of online discussion about how these people are on the government payroll, impacting American citizens, meaning their identities should be public.\n\n#My Take on This Drama\n\n***My Sympathy for Jennica***\n\nFirst, I want to address the backlash Jennica faced over her ASL skills. Many in the deaf community mocked her signing in the interview videos and even questioned whether she was actually deaf.\n\nIf you know me, you know I despise when people\u2014usually \u201cD\u201d Deaf community members\u2014judge deaf people with below-average ASL skills as \u2018not real Deaf.\u2019\n\nJennica explained that she is a nonverbal autistic deaf person. I\u2019ve met nonverbal autistic deaf people before, and I value them as part of our community. Just because her ASL isn\u2019t fluent or native doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not deaf. I see Jennica as one of us.\n\n#However\u2026\n\nThat said, I have zero sympathy for her role as a data/software engineer being used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling critical government functions that serve and protect disabled people\u2014all of us here.\n\nJennica claims Ricky doxxed her. That\u2019s bullshit. \n\nShe did public interviews showing her face. Yes, she wore sunglasses, but let\u2019s be real\u2014sunglasses aren\u2019t a disguise.\n\nShe was already newsworthy in the deaf community for being a deaf data/software engineer praised by Elon Musk and Charlie Kirk. She boasted about their praise on her website. She also made it publicly known she was joining DOGE.\n\nIt was inevitable that deaf people would start talking and someone would recognize her. Our community is too small for it not to happen.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Rolling Stone\u2019s article. Her endeavors with \"DataRepublicans\" were public enough to attract the attention from a major publication company. They went way deeper in exposing her background. Their criticism of Jennica was completely valid. That article was coming out regardless of Ricky's post. \n\nBy choosing to align herself with this effort, Jennica should have expected public scrutiny.\n\n#In Conclusion\u2026\n\nRicky did nothing wrong by naming her. It was going to happen anyway.\n\nAnd it\u2019s beyond hypocritical for right-wingers to accuse him of doxxing when they literally doxxed Ricky.\n\nSo here we are\u2014a deaf person in our community has aligned herself with an administration that is actively working against us. </author: HelensScarletFever>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: killerbrain toEvalutate=true/>\n    You said it well. It's extremely sad and pathetic that Jennica is assisting the same people working to destroy all the services she benefited from. She should not be attacked for her signing skills. She SHOULD be attacked for selling her community out. She, too, will find herself as fucked as the rest of us when she's no longer useful to this group.\n   </ author: killerbrain/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

Recently, she did a round of interviews with right-wing media outlets, where she communicated in ASL with interpreters.\n\nHere are couple of interviews:\n\n[BlazeTV Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNSzVw_GX5c)\n\n[The Daily Moth's coverage with another interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bZPlgJ2q-4)\n\nThis caught the attention of the notorious deaf vlogger, Ricky Taylor. \n\nHe spoke about this with some people in the deaf community and someone recognized her. That someone told him her real name. \n\nRicky made a Threads post where he named DataRepublican\u2019s real identity\u2014Jennica Pounds\u2014which set off a firestorm on social media. Jennica responded with the following Twitter post:\n\n>I have been doxxed. Rather than let others control the narrative, I am addressing this directly.\n\n>My name is Jennica Pounds. I recently resigned from my job to pursue DOGE-adjacent efforts full-time. While my background check is still in progress, my ultimate goal is to work with the Administration to cut waste and improve efficiency.\n\n>What began as a side hobby became a mission when I uncovered the role of NGOs in these issues. This is not about left or right. This is about us\u2014the people.\n\n>I gave up everything for this\u2014my safety, my career\u2014because I believe in what I am doing.\n\n>I am 100% Deaf and nonverbal. My lack of signing fluency does not make me any less Deaf. It is a result of a language impairment related to my autism called expressive dysphasia, which affects my ability to construct language fluently in real-time. This impacts my signing, speaking, and even writing, though writing allows me more time to correct mistakes. My interpreter and I spend hours refining my talking points to ensure she conveys what I mean, not just what I say.\n\n>I am Deaf. And being Deaf is not, and should never be, defined by one\u2019s signing ability, particularly when there are medical conditions involved.\n\n>I do not believe the Deaf community should be politically aligned with any party. A priority of mine has always been holding the Administration accountable to Deaf Americans, including advocating for policy changes such as allowing a second interpreter camera stream on television broadcasts. I will continue using my platform to push for these necessary changes.\u201d\n\nHer post triggered a wave of MAGA supporters (mostly hearing people) who brigaded Ricky Taylor\u2019s latest vlog about USAID, posting his home address, descriptions of his house and car, and threats against him\u2014literally doxxing him.\n\nRicky responded in a hilariously defiant way, mocking them. \n\nThen, lo and behold, [Rolling Stone published an article about Jennica Pounds](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/elon-musk-data-republican-anonymous-data-expert-doge-tech-1235280817/). The article referenced a \u201cdeaf man\u201d who named her\u2014obviously referring to Ricky.\n\nThe Rolling Stone article was brutal in its criticism of Jennica\u2019s role in spreading misinformation, which has been used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling key government functions. It also revealed details about her husband, home, distillery business, employment history, and a company she registered in Utah. Basically, it was a takedown piece.\n\nFYI - I heard Rolling Stone had been working on this article for a while, intending to be the first to expose Jennica\u2019s identity\u2014but Ricky beat them to it. That led to Rolling Stone reaching out to Ricky before publication, hence the vague reference to a \u201cdeaf man\u201d who named her.\n\nAlso the timing of this post is really perfect because today [The New York Times published a full list of DOGE staffers](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/27/us/politics/doge-staff-list.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare). \n\nMAGA supporters are now crying about doxxing\u2014the same way they did when Ricky exposed Jennica. But there\u2019s plenty of online discussion about how these people are on the government payroll, impacting American citizens, meaning their identities should be public.\n\n#My Take on This Drama\n\n***My Sympathy for Jennica***\n\nFirst, I want to address the backlash Jennica faced over her ASL skills. Many in the deaf community mocked her signing in the interview videos and even questioned whether she was actually deaf.\n\nIf you know me, you know I despise when people\u2014usually \u201cD\u201d Deaf community members\u2014judge deaf people with below-average ASL skills as \u2018not real Deaf.\u2019\n\nJennica explained that she is a nonverbal autistic deaf person. I\u2019ve met nonverbal autistic deaf people before, and I value them as part of our community. Just because her ASL isn\u2019t fluent or native doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not deaf. I see Jennica as one of us.\n\n#However\u2026\n\nThat said, I have zero sympathy for her role as a data/software engineer being used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling critical government functions that serve and protect disabled people\u2014all of us here.\n\nJennica claims Ricky doxxed her. That\u2019s bullshit. \n\nShe did public interviews showing her face. Yes, she wore sunglasses, but let\u2019s be real\u2014sunglasses aren\u2019t a disguise.\n\nShe was already newsworthy in the deaf community for being a deaf data/software engineer praised by Elon Musk and Charlie Kirk. She boasted about their praise on her website. She also made it publicly known she was joining DOGE.\n\nIt was inevitable that deaf people would start talking and someone would recognize her. Our community is too small for it not to happen.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Rolling Stone\u2019s article. Her endeavors with \"DataRepublicans\" were public enough to attract the attention from a major publication company. They went way deeper in exposing her background. Their criticism of Jennica was completely valid. That article was coming out regardless of Ricky's post. \n\nBy choosing to align herself with this effort, Jennica should have expected public scrutiny.\n\n#In Conclusion\u2026\n\nRicky did nothing wrong by naming her. It was going to happen anyway.\n\nAnd it\u2019s beyond hypocritical for right-wingers to accuse him of doxxing when they literally doxxed Ricky.\n\nSo here we are\u2014a deaf person in our community has aligned herself with an administration that is actively working against us. </author: HelensScarletFever>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: killerbrain toEvalutate=true/>\n    You said it well. It's extremely sad and pathetic that Jennica is assisting the same people working to destroy all the services she benefited from. She should not be attacked for her signing skills. She SHOULD be attacked for selling her community out. She, too, will find herself as fucked as the rest of us when she's no longer useful to this group.\n   </ author: killerbrain/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s an app I can download for my phone. I\u2019m going to the movies next week. I don\u2019t go often and I really don\u2019t want to have to ask for the closed caption device. TIA!  </author: alittlefaith530>\n<author: Kuildeous indent=1> Why not the closed caption device? Is it the fear of battery power? I had that situation with one theatre where twice the device ran out of juice. I suspect that it's negligent employees not fully charging them, but the owner said that he would investigate. Sometimes batteries go bad, so maybe he needs to replace them. \n\nI would be curious about a phone app because there's very little I can imagine that wouldn't intrude on other people's viewing pleasure, unlike the closed caption devices. \n\nAlso, caption algorithms have a long ways to go, so I would only trust professionally transcribed captions. \n\nI may check out Live Transcribe for those older movies that don't have captions loaded. </author: Kuildeous>\n<author: alittlefaith530 indent=2> That is a very good point about the phone. \n\nIt\u2019s fear of taking it away from someone who might need it more than I do. I have moderate/severe (almost profound) loss but only in one ear. I can and have managed, but for this movie I would prefer to get all of the dialog. The device would greatly help me but I wouldn\u2019t want to take it from someone who needs it more than I do. </author: alittlefaith530>\n<author: Kuildeous indent=3> That's considerate of you. From my experience, I haven't see these caption devices run out. I suppose it could be worth waiting until 5 minutes before the movie and then check in with them if they have one available. \n\nBut hearing loss is hearing loss. If you need captions to fully understand the movie, I don't think we can really say you're less deserving of this assistance than others. \n\nEspecially since movies nowadays are so freakin' loud that dialogue gets swallowed up more often than not. \n\nI've seen some theatres offer open captions for select viewings. I may have to give that a try. Still not a common occurrence, so good luck finding one of those. </author: Kuildeous>\n<author: alittlefaith530 indent=4> Thank you. That means a lot to me. Sometimes I don\u2019t feel deserving. \n\nOh yeah movies now are so hard. I\u2019m going to see the new Deadpool and they talk to fast in those movies. </author: alittlefaith530>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: Kuildeous toEvalutate=true/>\n    Ugh.

My name is Chris and I have had high frequency hearing loss all of my life, since birth. I am a software developer and this is an iPhone app I developed that generates live transcriptions allowing you to see captions of speech, then save them as transcripts, and then print, email, or text the transcripts. This is a beta version, but it is free to download and use from the\u00a0[apple app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/livecaptionsai/id6464103487). All feedback is welcome! </author: GreenblattInvestor>\n<author: peachyqueen_7 indent=1> This is awesome!

It also bugs me when people shrug off closed captions, which makes me anxious and nervous the next time to ask. \n\nPhone calls bug me. I prefer texting and video call over phone calls. We're lucky to have that these days. \n\nI'm tired of being told \"I'll tell you later\" because I know you'll forget. Just tell me now!\n\nCar radios that are too quiet...\nMasks...\nPeople that won't speak up...\nPeople that whisper in a mask...\nKnowing that wind and bugs make noise or that people can hear the toilet flush from a few rooms away...\n\nNot only do people not believe me that I can't hear in my left ear but most don't take me seriously when I say I can't see at night. \n\nWhy can't any of these \"disabilities\" be talked about? </author: Icy-Coffee-7452>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: catpiss_backpack toEvalutate=true/>\n    I am Deaf/HOH bilingual bicultural but of course, hearing people won\u2019t understand what that even means. I hate wearing my hearing aids and would prefer to just not. But it\u2019s hard to enforce my boundaries with hearing people who have never had to think about the way they communicate before. They\u2019re just used to mumbling to each other across the room and can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like not being able to hear it. And then you feel disheartened and tired asking repeatedly. And wondering how much information you miss all the time because they might be calling something out from over there. So frustrating. It\u2019s a change of point of view for them but you can\u2019t really force someone to examine that like\u2026 at work\n   </ author: catpiss_backpack/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

I work for a big box retail store. In our break room we have a television. I don't have a smartphone, but everyone else does, so I am typically the only one watching the TV.\n\nI always turn on Closed Captioning so I can understand what's going on, especially since there is a lot  of other noise \\(people talking, watching videos on their phones without headphones, loud box fans because it's hot\\).\n\nThere is an individual, who I'm going to call \"John,\" who hates Closed Captioning for some reason.\n\nI never turn off CC when my break is over. Other people I work with have told me that they prefer it on because some of them also have hearing problems \\(but don't identify as Hard of Hearing\\), or they sit far away from the TV and can't hear it from where they are, or just because it helps them focus on what's happening. However, none of these people turn on the CC themselves, the just prefer it when it's already on, so I am the only one who switches it on.\n\nA few weeks ago I was on one of my breaks watching TV with CC when John walks up to me and says very firmly, \"Hey Carly, you need to turn the captions off when you're done.\"\n\nMe: \"Why?\"\n\nJohn: \"You're the only person in this store who has problems with their ears, so you need to turn the captions off.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not the only one who is Hard of Hearing in this store, there are other people who needs captions.\" \\(\\(At this time there were two other people who also identified as Hard of Hearing\\)\\)\n\nJohn: \"Oh yeah, who?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not outing people's medical conditions to you.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn the captions off.\"\n\nIt was a very odd interaction.\n\nSomething similar happened the next week, but this time I was sitting with two other people, and the entire time John was telling me that I need to turn off the captions, the other two were telling him that they wanted the captions on, but he absolutely didn't listen to them.\n\nLast week I was clocked out for lunch so I decided to do some shopping. John saw me and called my name, then marched right up to me and very aggressively said \"You **need** to turn the captions off when you're done in the break room.\"\n\nMe: \"That's very [ableist](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism) of you to say, John.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn off the captions.\"\n\nMe: \"John, I'm shopping right now.\"\n\nThen I turned around and walked off to finish getting groceries.\n\nWhen I clocked in this past Monday, I immediately went to HR and told them that I was being intimidated by a coworker because of my disability. They said that they would follow up. I believe they left before they were able to talk to him.\n\nAt my store we announce when we are going to break over our radios so that people know if they need to watch that area. After I announced that I was going on lunch, I went to the break room and saw John's stuff sitting across from where I usually sit \\(by the TV so I can hear better\\), and immediately sat farther away near a coworker.\n\nShe told me that just before I got there John was ranting to a new coworker of ours that I always turn on the captions but that he wasn't going to let me, so he was going to hide the remote.\n\nI looked around and noticed that the remote was indeed missing. I was furious, so I got up to go talk to his immediate supervisor because this is absolutely ridiculous. I passed by John, who was putting something in his locker, and he sneered at me, saying, \"Looking for something, Carly?\"\n\nI didn't respond, but just walked past him and talked to his supervisor, who said he would talk to him. I also told my boss, and wrote down an account of what happened to give to HR.\n\nWhen I went back in to the break room I sat by my coworker again, and was talking with her. John kept trying to make conversation but I purposefully didn't look at him so I couldn't read his lips, but I was able to hear him say \"What, can she not hear me or something?\"\n\nHe sounded genuinely surprised that the Hard of Hearing girl who needs Closed Captioning might not be able to hear him, and even more surprised that I didn't want to talk to him after he purposefully hid the remote from me.\n\nLiterally Closed Captioning is just such an odd thing to be so violently opposed to, and he is probably the most \"Think Hearing\" person I've ever had the displeasure to work with. It's almost impressive how clueless he is.\n\nI had yesterday off, but will be working tonight. I'm curious what HR has to say, if they are there this evening.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I am honestly just astonished by this aggressive behavior.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot to tell you guys the best part of this entire situation! He doesn't even *watch* the TV most of the time. I've seen him turn off the CC or change the channel \\(without asking anyone else in the break room, he'll just grab the remote and change it\\), and then he will sit with his back to the TV and watch videos on his phone with the volume all the way up. He did this once when a *commercial* for American Idol came on, just grabbed the remote and changed the channel. I asked him why he changed the channel without asking and he just said \"I hate American Idol,\" and then turned around and watched videos on his phone, so I don't know what his deal is.  \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/8llwj8/workplace_bully_wont_let_me_have_cc/dzhlae0/) </author: Carlyndra>\n<author: Carlyndra indent=1> Update: I just got home from work.  \n\nI talked to HR again, and they said they were going to talk to John. John is now no longer allowed to speak to me in any capacity, and if I'm able to I'm allowed to try to take my breaks at different times than him.  \n\nI pushed my HR for more info, and they said they are partnering with the person one step above them, but if John doesn't say or do anything else, then this is the end of it, and they aren't going to pursue any further corrective action.   </author: Carlyndra>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: pilotavery toEvalutate=true/>\n    From what you've explained, I don't think he's going to last very long.\n   </ author: pilotavery/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

Recently, she did a round of interviews with right-wing media outlets, where she communicated in ASL with interpreters.\n\nHere are couple of interviews:\n\n[BlazeTV Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNSzVw_GX5c)\n\n[The Daily Moth's coverage with another interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bZPlgJ2q-4)\n\nThis caught the attention of the notorious deaf vlogger, Ricky Taylor. \n\nHe spoke about this with some people in the deaf community and someone recognized her. That someone told him her real name. \n\nRicky made a Threads post where he named DataRepublican\u2019s real identity\u2014Jennica Pounds\u2014which set off a firestorm on social media. Jennica responded with the following Twitter post:\n\n>I have been doxxed. Rather than let others control the narrative, I am addressing this directly.\n\n>My name is Jennica Pounds. I recently resigned from my job to pursue DOGE-adjacent efforts full-time. While my background check is still in progress, my ultimate goal is to work with the Administration to cut waste and improve efficiency.\n\n>What began as a side hobby became a mission when I uncovered the role of NGOs in these issues. This is not about left or right. This is about us\u2014the people.\n\n>I gave up everything for this\u2014my safety, my career\u2014because I believe in what I am doing.\n\n>I am 100% Deaf and nonverbal. My lack of signing fluency does not make me any less Deaf. It is a result of a language impairment related to my autism called expressive dysphasia, which affects my ability to construct language fluently in real-time. This impacts my signing, speaking, and even writing, though writing allows me more time to correct mistakes. My interpreter and I spend hours refining my talking points to ensure she conveys what I mean, not just what I say.\n\n>I am Deaf. And being Deaf is not, and should never be, defined by one\u2019s signing ability, particularly when there are medical conditions involved.\n\n>I do not believe the Deaf community should be politically aligned with any party. A priority of mine has always been holding the Administration accountable to Deaf Americans, including advocating for policy changes such as allowing a second interpreter camera stream on television broadcasts. I will continue using my platform to push for these necessary changes.\u201d\n\nHer post triggered a wave of MAGA supporters (mostly hearing people) who brigaded Ricky Taylor\u2019s latest vlog about USAID, posting his home address, descriptions of his house and car, and threats against him\u2014literally doxxing him.\n\nRicky responded in a hilariously defiant way, mocking them. \n\nThen, lo and behold, [Rolling Stone published an article about Jennica Pounds](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/elon-musk-data-republican-anonymous-data-expert-doge-tech-1235280817/). The article referenced a \u201cdeaf man\u201d who named her\u2014obviously referring to Ricky.\n\nThe Rolling Stone article was brutal in its criticism of Jennica\u2019s role in spreading misinformation, which has been used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling key government functions. It also revealed details about her husband, home, distillery business, employment history, and a company she registered in Utah. Basically, it was a takedown piece.\n\nFYI - I heard Rolling Stone had been working on this article for a while, intending to be the first to expose Jennica\u2019s identity\u2014but Ricky beat them to it. That led to Rolling Stone reaching out to Ricky before publication, hence the vague reference to a \u201cdeaf man\u201d who named her.\n\nAlso the timing of this post is really perfect because today [The New York Times published a full list of DOGE staffers](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/27/us/politics/doge-staff-list.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare). \n\nMAGA supporters are now crying about doxxing\u2014the same way they did when Ricky exposed Jennica. But there\u2019s plenty of online discussion about how these people are on the government payroll, impacting American citizens, meaning their identities should be public.\n\n#My Take on This Drama\n\n***My Sympathy for Jennica***\n\nFirst, I want to address the backlash Jennica faced over her ASL skills. Many in the deaf community mocked her signing in the interview videos and even questioned whether she was actually deaf.\n\nIf you know me, you know I despise when people\u2014usually \u201cD\u201d Deaf community members\u2014judge deaf people with below-average ASL skills as \u2018not real Deaf.\u2019\n\nJennica explained that she is a nonverbal autistic deaf person. I\u2019ve met nonverbal autistic deaf people before, and I value them as part of our community. Just because her ASL isn\u2019t fluent or native doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not deaf. I see Jennica as one of us.\n\n#However\u2026\n\nThat said, I have zero sympathy for her role as a data/software engineer being used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling critical government functions that serve and protect disabled people\u2014all of us here.\n\nJennica claims Ricky doxxed her. That\u2019s bullshit. \n\nShe did public interviews showing her face. Yes, she wore sunglasses, but let\u2019s be real\u2014sunglasses aren\u2019t a disguise.\n\nShe was already newsworthy in the deaf community for being a deaf data/software engineer praised by Elon Musk and Charlie Kirk. She boasted about their praise on her website. She also made it publicly known she was joining DOGE.\n\nIt was inevitable that deaf people would start talking and someone would recognize her. Our community is too small for it not to happen.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Rolling Stone\u2019s article. Her endeavors with \"DataRepublicans\" were public enough to attract the attention from a major publication company. They went way deeper in exposing her background. Their criticism of Jennica was completely valid. That article was coming out regardless of Ricky's post. \n\nBy choosing to align herself with this effort, Jennica should have expected public scrutiny.\n\n#In Conclusion\u2026\n\nRicky did nothing wrong by naming her.

I was trying to ask if they specifically want open captions only or if something like rear window captioning might be an acceptable alternative but they blocked me before I finished writing the question. \n\nI framed the question by explaining that on-screen captions plus camera movement can trigger my motion sickness, bc I was trying to Illustrate that open captions on all movies always might be more than a preference issue for some ppl, but they might have just assumed I was being stupid or argumentative or trolling. Which is fine. I am indeed stupid a lot and no one has to read my thoughts or answer my questions. \n\nBut I'm more concerned that there's maybe something about my question that was legitimately offensive. I tried googling it, but the only thing seems to be that rear window is prohibitively expensive so maybe that's not accessible if it can't be available equally? Or is open captioning preferred by the Deaf community bc it's very visible and automatic rather than just being an option ppl have to specifically seek out or try to find? Or some other reason? \n\nI genuinely want to learn people's opinions and perspectives. Im totally not passionate about rear window captioning or even movies and television at all. I'm not invested in the answer either way, but I do want to avoid being unintentionally hurtful or dismissive in the future and learn more about the topic in general. </author: iamasecretthrowaway>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: surdophobe toEvalutate=true/>\n    OK first of all rear-window captioning was a film-only thing. It went away about 11 years ago in the digital conversion. So please consider that in your search you are looking at very old data and very old arguments and obsolete restrictions against that data. \n\nBack then the only way for an open captioned movie to exist was to take a physical copy of the movie and use a laser to permanently etch the captions onto the film.  But now, every single theater and every single copy of the movie can be viewed with open captions. It just a matter of the projector operators loading into their equipment that way.  \n\n>I framed the question by explaining that on-screen captions plus camera movement can trigger my motion sickness,\n\nThat's quite a dubious claim, to be honest. I too would assume you were making shit up to be argumentive. \n\n>But I'm more concerned that there's maybe something about my question that was legitimately offensive.\n\nYou are extremely ill-informed about how bad the problem has been for the last 10+ years.  The tech that replaced rear-window captioning has been abysmal. There's no longer the excuse of scarcity or expense from the movie theaters. \n\n>Im totally not passionate about rear window captioning\n\nI find this to be doubtful as well, you keep using terminology for tech that has not existed for over a decade.  If you were passionate at all you would have read up on the history of this issue and hopefully have realized how little you currently know about all this.\n   </ author: surdophobe/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s an app I can download for my phone. I\u2019m going to the movies next week. I don\u2019t go often and I really don\u2019t want to have to ask for the closed caption device. TIA!  </author: alittlefaith530>\n<author: Kuildeous indent=1> Why not the closed caption device? Is it the fear of battery power? I had that situation with one theatre where twice the device ran out of juice. I suspect that it's negligent employees not fully charging them, but the owner said that he would investigate. Sometimes batteries go bad, so maybe he needs to replace them. \n\nI would be curious about a phone app because there's very little I can imagine that wouldn't intrude on other people's viewing pleasure, unlike the closed caption devices. \n\nAlso, caption algorithms have a long ways to go, so I would only trust professionally transcribed captions. \n\nI may check out Live Transcribe for those older movies that don't have captions loaded. </author: Kuildeous>\n<author: alittlefaith530 indent=2> That is a very good point about the phone. \n\nIt\u2019s fear of taking it away from someone who might need it more than I do. I have moderate/severe (almost profound) loss but only in one ear. I can and have managed, but for this movie I would prefer to get all of the dialog. The device would greatly help me but I wouldn\u2019t want to take it from someone who needs it more than I do. </author: alittlefaith530>\n<author: Kuildeous indent=3> That's considerate of you. From my experience, I haven't see these caption devices run out. I suppose it could be worth waiting until 5 minutes before the movie and then check in with them if they have one available. \n\nBut hearing loss is hearing loss. If you need captions to fully understand the movie, I don't think we can really say you're less deserving of this assistance than others. \n\nEspecially since movies nowadays are so freakin' loud that dialogue gets swallowed up more often than not. \n\nI've seen some theatres offer open captions for select viewings. I may have to give that a try. Still not a common occurrence, so good luck finding one of those. </author: Kuildeous>\n<author: alittlefaith530 indent=4> Thank you. That means a lot to me. Sometimes I don\u2019t feel deserving. \n\nOh yeah movies now are so hard. I\u2019m going to see the new Deadpool and they talk to fast in those movies. </author: alittlefaith530>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: Kuildeous toEvalutate=true/>\n    Ugh. I have to go rewatch the new Deadpool because the caption device *did* shut off 2/3 through. Sadly that was part of my earlier anecdote. Gonna give that theatre a pause while they gather their shit.

I was so pleasantly surprised and I'll be using it again. It was slightly delayed but not enough to annoy me too much. I know live captioning has been discussed here but I haven't seen anything about the Pixel so I thought I'd share my experience. \n\n I'm a lip reader and sometimes the video cuts out but the audio keeps going. So without the captions I'm lost even with the audio but with the captions I still understood what was being said. I think it would even benefit non-HoH users who have a bit of a laggy connection.

Ally says \"No, I walked with Rob.\"\n\nShe seems to make the \"R\" symbol and tap it on her cheek. Can someone explain how this signifies \"Rob?\"\n\nRob is a classmate, and seems to be possibly her boyfriend (I've only seen 8 minutes of this movie) if that helps.\n\nI was just curious how this shorthand works. </author: EarthAllAlong>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: GG-Gdog toEvalutate=true/>\n    If you\u2019re looking for a film with a better representation of sign language, I would give A Quiet Place (also on Netflix). It\u2019s a much better film and they actually do a decent job of representing sign language and one person\u2019s experience of being Deaf. It\u2019s also jus a good movie. \nIn general, be wary of using commercial films as a sign language teacher. They\u2019re not always as accurate as they should be and as people want them to be. But I hope you enjoy the movie regardless!\n   </ author: GG-Gdog/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

Recently, she did a round of interviews with right-wing media outlets, where she communicated in ASL with interpreters.\n\nHere are couple of interviews:\n\n[BlazeTV Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNSzVw_GX5c)\n\n[The Daily Moth's coverage with another interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bZPlgJ2q-4)\n\nThis caught the attention of the notorious deaf vlogger, Ricky Taylor. \n\nHe spoke about this with some people in the deaf community and someone recognized her. That someone told him her real name. \n\nRicky made a Threads post where he named DataRepublican\u2019s real identity\u2014Jennica Pounds\u2014which set off a firestorm on social media. Jennica responded with the following Twitter post:\n\n>I have been doxxed. Rather than let others control the narrative, I am addressing this directly.\n\n>My name is Jennica Pounds. I recently resigned from my job to pursue DOGE-adjacent efforts full-time. While my background check is still in progress, my ultimate goal is to work with the Administration to cut waste and improve efficiency.\n\n>What began as a side hobby became a mission when I uncovered the role of NGOs in these issues. This is not about left or right. This is about us\u2014the people.\n\n>I gave up everything for this\u2014my safety, my career\u2014because I believe in what I am doing.\n\n>I am 100% Deaf and nonverbal. My lack of signing fluency does not make me any less Deaf. It is a result of a language impairment related to my autism called expressive dysphasia, which affects my ability to construct language fluently in real-time. This impacts my signing, speaking, and even writing, though writing allows me more time to correct mistakes. My interpreter and I spend hours refining my talking points to ensure she conveys what I mean, not just what I say.\n\n>I am Deaf. And being Deaf is not, and should never be, defined by one\u2019s signing ability, particularly when there are medical conditions involved.\n\n>I do not believe the Deaf community should be politically aligned with any party. A priority of mine has always been holding the Administration accountable to Deaf Americans, including advocating for policy changes such as allowing a second interpreter camera stream on television broadcasts. I will continue using my platform to push for these necessary changes.\u201d\n\nHer post triggered a wave of MAGA supporters (mostly hearing people) who brigaded Ricky Taylor\u2019s latest vlog about USAID, posting his home address, descriptions of his house and car, and threats against him\u2014literally doxxing him.\n\nRicky responded in a hilariously defiant way, mocking them. \n\nThen, lo and behold, [Rolling Stone published an article about Jennica Pounds](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/elon-musk-data-republican-anonymous-data-expert-doge-tech-1235280817/). The article referenced a \u201cdeaf man\u201d who named her\u2014obviously referring to Ricky.\n\nThe Rolling Stone article was brutal in its criticism of Jennica\u2019s role in spreading misinformation, which has been used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling key government functions. It also revealed details about her husband, home, distillery business, employment history, and a company she registered in Utah. Basically, it was a takedown piece.\n\nFYI - I heard Rolling Stone had been working on this article for a while, intending to be the first to expose Jennica\u2019s identity\u2014but Ricky beat them to it. That led to Rolling Stone reaching out to Ricky before publication, hence the vague reference to a \u201cdeaf man\u201d who named her.\n\nAlso the timing of this post is really perfect because today [The New York Times published a full list of DOGE staffers](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/27/us/politics/doge-staff-list.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare). \n\nMAGA supporters are now crying about doxxing\u2014the same way they did when Ricky exposed Jennica. But there\u2019s plenty of online discussion about how these people are on the government payroll, impacting American citizens, meaning their identities should be public.\n\n#My Take on This Drama\n\n***My Sympathy for Jennica***\n\nFirst, I want to address the backlash Jennica faced over her ASL skills. Many in the deaf community mocked her signing in the interview videos and even questioned whether she was actually deaf.\n\nIf you know me, you know I despise when people\u2014usually \u201cD\u201d Deaf community members\u2014judge deaf people with below-average ASL skills as \u2018not real Deaf.\u2019\n\nJennica explained that she is a nonverbal autistic deaf person. I\u2019ve met nonverbal autistic deaf people before, and I value them as part of our community. Just because her ASL isn\u2019t fluent or native doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not deaf. I see Jennica as one of us.\n\n#However\u2026\n\nThat said, I have zero sympathy for her role as a data/software engineer being used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling critical government functions that serve and protect disabled people\u2014all of us here.\n\nJennica claims Ricky doxxed her. That\u2019s bullshit. \n\nShe did public interviews showing her face. Yes, she wore sunglasses, but let\u2019s be real\u2014sunglasses aren\u2019t a disguise.\n\nShe was already newsworthy in the deaf community for being a deaf data/software engineer praised by Elon Musk and Charlie Kirk. She boasted about their praise on her website. She also made it publicly known she was joining DOGE.\n\nIt was inevitable that deaf people would start talking and someone would recognize her. Our community is too small for it not to happen.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Rolling Stone\u2019s article. Her endeavors with \"DataRepublicans\" were public enough to attract the attention from a major publication company. They went way deeper in exposing her background. Their criticism of Jennica was completely valid. That article was coming out regardless of Ricky's post. \n\nBy choosing to align herself with this effort, Jennica should have expected public scrutiny.\n\n#In Conclusion\u2026\n\nRicky did nothing wrong by naming her. It was going to happen anyway.\n\nAnd it\u2019s beyond hypocritical for right-wingers to accuse him of doxxing when they literally doxxed Ricky.\n\nSo here we are\u2014a deaf person in our community has aligned herself with an administration that is actively working against us. </author: HelensScarletFever>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: killerbrain toEvalutate=true/>\n    You said it well. It's extremely sad and pathetic that Jennica is assisting the same people working to destroy all the services she benefited from. She should not be attacked for her signing skills. She SHOULD be attacked for selling her community out. She, too, will find herself as fucked as the rest of us when she's no longer useful to this group.\n   </ author: killerbrain/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

I was trying to ask if they specifically want open captions only or if something like rear window captioning might be an acceptable alternative but they blocked me before I finished writing the question. \n\nI framed the question by explaining that on-screen captions plus camera movement can trigger my motion sickness, bc I was trying to Illustrate that open captions on all movies always might be more than a preference issue for some ppl, but they might have just assumed I was being stupid or argumentative or trolling. Which is fine. I am indeed stupid a lot and no one has to read my thoughts or answer my questions. \n\nBut I'm more concerned that there's maybe something about my question that was legitimately offensive. I tried googling it, but the only thing seems to be that rear window is prohibitively expensive so maybe that's not accessible if it can't be available equally? Or is open captioning preferred by the Deaf community bc it's very visible and automatic rather than just being an option ppl have to specifically seek out or try to find? Or some other reason? \n\nI genuinely want to learn people's opinions and perspectives. Im totally not passionate about rear window captioning or even movies and television at all. I'm not invested in the answer either way, but I do want to avoid being unintentionally hurtful or dismissive in the future and learn more about the topic in general. </author: iamasecretthrowaway>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: surdophobe toEvalutate=true/>\n    OK first of all rear-window captioning was a film-only thing. It went away about 11 years ago in the digital conversion. So please consider that in your search you are looking at very old data and very old arguments and obsolete restrictions against that data. \n\nBack then the only way for an open captioned movie to exist was to take a physical copy of the movie and use a laser to permanently etch the captions onto the film.  But now, every single theater and every single copy of the movie can be viewed with open captions. It just a matter of the projector operators loading into their equipment that way.  \n\n>I framed the question by explaining that on-screen captions plus camera movement can trigger my motion sickness,\n\nThat's quite a dubious claim, to be honest. I too would assume you were making shit up to be argumentive. \n\n>But I'm more concerned that there's maybe something about my question that was legitimately offensive.\n\nYou are extremely ill-informed about how bad the problem has been for the last 10+ years.  The tech that replaced rear-window captioning has been abysmal. There's no longer the excuse of scarcity or expense from the movie theaters. \n\n>Im totally not passionate about rear window captioning\n\nI find this to be doubtful as well, you keep using terminology for tech that has not existed for over a decade.  If you were passionate at all you would have read up on the history of this issue and hopefully have realized how little you currently know about all this.\n   </ author: surdophobe/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

I work for a big box retail store. In our break room we have a television. I don't have a smartphone, but everyone else does, so I am typically the only one watching the TV.\n\nI always turn on Closed Captioning so I can understand what's going on, especially since there is a lot  of other noise \\(people talking, watching videos on their phones without headphones, loud box fans because it's hot\\).\n\nThere is an individual, who I'm going to call \"John,\" who hates Closed Captioning for some reason.\n\nI never turn off CC when my break is over. Other people I work with have told me that they prefer it on because some of them also have hearing problems \\(but don't identify as Hard of Hearing\\), or they sit far away from the TV and can't hear it from where they are, or just because it helps them focus on what's happening. However, none of these people turn on the CC themselves, the just prefer it when it's already on, so I am the only one who switches it on.\n\nA few weeks ago I was on one of my breaks watching TV with CC when John walks up to me and says very firmly, \"Hey Carly, you need to turn the captions off when you're done.\"\n\nMe: \"Why?\"\n\nJohn: \"You're the only person in this store who has problems with their ears, so you need to turn the captions off.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not the only one who is Hard of Hearing in this store, there are other people who needs captions.\" \\(\\(At this time there were two other people who also identified as Hard of Hearing\\)\\)\n\nJohn: \"Oh yeah, who?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not outing people's medical conditions to you.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn the captions off.\"\n\nIt was a very odd interaction.\n\nSomething similar happened the next week, but this time I was sitting with two other people, and the entire time John was telling me that I need to turn off the captions, the other two were telling him that they wanted the captions on, but he absolutely didn't listen to them.\n\nLast week I was clocked out for lunch so I decided to do some shopping. John saw me and called my name, then marched right up to me and very aggressively said \"You **need** to turn the captions off when you're done in the break room.\"\n\nMe: \"That's very [ableist](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism) of you to say, John.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn off the captions.\"\n\nMe: \"John, I'm shopping right now.\"\n\nThen I turned around and walked off to finish getting groceries.\n\nWhen I clocked in this past Monday, I immediately went to HR and told them that I was being intimidated by a coworker because of my disability. They said that they would follow up. I believe they left before they were able to talk to him.\n\nAt my store we announce when we are going to break over our radios so that people know if they need to watch that area. After I announced that I was going on lunch, I went to the break room and saw John's stuff sitting across from where I usually sit \\(by the TV so I can hear better\\), and immediately sat farther away near a coworker.\n\nShe told me that just before I got there John was ranting to a new coworker of ours that I always turn on the captions but that he wasn't going to let me, so he was going to hide the remote.\n\nI looked around and noticed that the remote was indeed missing. I was furious, so I got up to go talk to his immediate supervisor because this is absolutely ridiculous. I passed by John, who was putting something in his locker, and he sneered at me, saying, \"Looking for something, Carly?\"\n\nI didn't respond, but just walked past him and talked to his supervisor, who said he would talk to him. I also told my boss, and wrote down an account of what happened to give to HR.\n\nWhen I went back in to the break room I sat by my coworker again, and was talking with her. John kept trying to make conversation but I purposefully didn't look at him so I couldn't read his lips, but I was able to hear him say \"What, can she not hear me or something?\"\n\nHe sounded genuinely surprised that the Hard of Hearing girl who needs Closed Captioning might not be able to hear him, and even more surprised that I didn't want to talk to him after he purposefully hid the remote from me.\n\nLiterally Closed Captioning is just such an odd thing to be so violently opposed to, and he is probably the most \"Think Hearing\" person I've ever had the displeasure to work with. It's almost impressive how clueless he is.\n\nI had yesterday off, but will be working tonight. I'm curious what HR has to say, if they are there this evening.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I am honestly just astonished by this aggressive behavior.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot to tell you guys the best part of this entire situation! He doesn't even *watch* the TV most of the time. I've seen him turn off the CC or change the channel \\(without asking anyone else in the break room, he'll just grab the remote and change it\\), and then he will sit with his back to the TV and watch videos on his phone with the volume all the way up. He did this once when a *commercial* for American Idol came on, just grabbed the remote and changed the channel. I asked him why he changed the channel without asking and he just said \"I hate American Idol,\" and then turned around and watched videos on his phone, so I don't know what his deal is.  \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/8llwj8/workplace_bully_wont_let_me_have_cc/dzhlae0/) </author: Carlyndra>\n<author: Carlyndra indent=1> Update: I just got home from work.  \n\nI talked to HR again, and they said they were going to talk to John. John is now no longer allowed to speak to me in any capacity, and if I'm able to I'm allowed to try to take my breaks at different times than him.  \n\nI pushed my HR for more info, and they said they are partnering with the person one step above them, but if John doesn't say or do anything else, then this is the end of it, and they aren't going to pursue any further corrective action.   </author: Carlyndra>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: pilotavery toEvalutate=true/>\n    From what you've explained, I don't think he's going to last very long.\n   </ author: pilotavery/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s an app I can download for my phone. I\u2019m going to the movies next week. I don\u2019t go often and I really don\u2019t want to have to ask for the closed caption device. TIA!  </author: alittlefaith530>\n<author: Kuildeous indent=1> Why not the closed caption device? Is it the fear of battery power? I had that situation with one theatre where twice the device ran out of juice. I suspect that it's negligent employees not fully charging them, but the owner said that he would investigate. Sometimes batteries go bad, so maybe he needs to replace them. \n\nI would be curious about a phone app because there's very little I can imagine that wouldn't intrude on other people's viewing pleasure, unlike the closed caption devices. \n\nAlso, caption algorithms have a long ways to go, so I would only trust professionally transcribed captions. \n\nI may check out Live Transcribe for those older movies that don't have captions loaded. </author: Kuildeous>\n<author: alittlefaith530 indent=2> That is a very good point about the phone. \n\nIt\u2019s fear of taking it away from someone who might need it more than I do. I have moderate/severe (almost profound) loss but only in one ear. I can and have managed, but for this movie I would prefer to get all of the dialog. The device would greatly help me but I wouldn\u2019t want to take it from someone who needs it more than I do. </author: alittlefaith530>\n<author: Kuildeous indent=3> That's considerate of you. From my experience, I haven't see these caption devices run out. I suppose it could be worth waiting until 5 minutes before the movie and then check in with them if they have one available. \n\nBut hearing loss is hearing loss. If you need captions to fully understand the movie, I don't think we can really say you're less deserving of this assistance than others. \n\nEspecially since movies nowadays are so freakin' loud that dialogue gets swallowed up more often than not. \n\nI've seen some theatres offer open captions for select viewings. I may have to give that a try. Still not a common occurrence, so good luck finding one of those. </author: Kuildeous>\n<author: alittlefaith530 indent=4> Thank you. That means a lot to me. Sometimes I don\u2019t feel deserving. \n\nOh yeah movies now are so hard. I\u2019m going to see the new Deadpool and they talk to fast in those movies. </author: alittlefaith530>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: Kuildeous toEvalutate=true/>\n    Ugh. I have to go rewatch the new Deadpool because the caption device *did* shut off 2/3 through. Sadly that was part of my earlier anecdote. Gonna give that theatre a pause while they gather their shit.

We (the network) would like to create a show in which the deaf community is our first priority. We will have the characters use American sign language to communicate. However, I'd also like to know what you (the deaf community) feel is missing in television when it comes to making your experience more enjoyable while consuming content. Please let me know what you would like to see more of in television! The more details, the better. </author: underthemoonlight08>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: Distracted-by-Shiny toEvalutate=true/>\n    Accurate captions - the absolute #1 thing\n\nMaybe show how hearing people can communicate with deaf by using phone apps\n\nMaybe show the pros and cons of interactions with and without hearing aids\n\nIf it\u2019s America, you can show how awful our medical system, employment, & disability is for deaf people. \n\nMaybe show a combination of hearing and deaf people. Deaf people are part of the world.\n\nMy first thought about a Sci Fi deaf show is how scary being in the dark is if you can\u2019t hear.\n\nIt sucks to be in the dark. I try not to go out at night.\n\nMy son likes to sneak up and scare me for fun after I go to bed. It\u2019s kinda a fun game we play. I can\u2019t hear him sneaking in the dark but I look for visual cues. He\u2019s gotten me real good a couple of times.\n\nI\u2019m an easy scare at haunted houses.\n\nOn the plus side, I have excellent visual memory and can tell you if something has moved or where it was last seen. It\u2019s like detective show accurate. If it\u2019s moved an inch, I\u2019ve noticed.\n   </ author: Distracted-by-Shiny/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

Ally says \"No, I walked with Rob.\"\n\nShe seems to make the \"R\" symbol and tap it on her cheek. Can someone explain how this signifies \"Rob?\"\n\nRob is a classmate, and seems to be possibly her boyfriend (I've only seen 8 minutes of this movie) if that helps.\n\nI was just curious how this shorthand works. </author: EarthAllAlong>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: GG-Gdog toEvalutate=true/>\n    If you\u2019re looking for a film with a better representation of sign language, I would give A Quiet Place (also on Netflix). It\u2019s a much better film and they actually do a decent job of representing sign language and one person\u2019s experience of being Deaf. It\u2019s also jus a good movie. \nIn general, be wary of using commercial films as a sign language teacher. They\u2019re not always as accurate as they should be and as people want them to be. But I hope you enjoy the movie regardless!\n   </ author: GG-Gdog/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

I was so pleasantly surprised and I'll be using it again. It was slightly delayed but not enough to annoy me too much. I know live captioning has been discussed here but I haven't seen anything about the Pixel so I thought I'd share my experience. \n\n I'm a lip reader and sometimes the video cuts out but the audio keeps going. So without the captions I'm lost even with the audio but with the captions I still understood what was being said. I think it would even benefit non-HoH users who have a bit of a laggy connection.

It also bugs me when people shrug off closed captions, which makes me anxious and nervous the next time to ask. \n\nPhone calls bug me. I prefer texting and video call over phone calls.

I work for a big box retail store. In our break room we have a television. I don't have a smartphone, but everyone else does, so I am typically the only one watching the TV.\n\nI always turn on Closed Captioning so I can understand what's going on, especially since there is a lot  of other noise \\(people talking, watching videos on their phones without headphones, loud box fans because it's hot\\).\n\nThere is an individual, who I'm going to call \"John,\" who hates Closed Captioning for some reason.\n\nI never turn off CC when my break is over. Other people I work with have told me that they prefer it on because some of them also have hearing problems \\(but don't identify as Hard of Hearing\\), or they sit far away from the TV and can't hear it from where they are, or just because it helps them focus on what's happening. However, none of these people turn on the CC themselves, the just prefer it when it's already on, so I am the only one who switches it on.\n\nA few weeks ago I was on one of my breaks watching TV with CC when John walks up to me and says very firmly, \"Hey Carly, you need to turn the captions off when you're done.\"\n\nMe: \"Why?\"\n\nJohn: \"You're the only person in this store who has problems with their ears, so you need to turn the captions off.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not the only one who is Hard of Hearing in this store, there are other people who needs captions.\" \\(\\(At this time there were two other people who also identified as Hard of Hearing\\)\\)\n\nJohn: \"Oh yeah, who?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not outing people's medical conditions to you.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn the captions off.\"\n\nIt was a very odd interaction.\n\nSomething similar happened the next week, but this time I was sitting with two other people, and the entire time John was telling me that I need to turn off the captions, the other two were telling him that they wanted the captions on, but he absolutely didn't listen to them.\n\nLast week I was clocked out for lunch so I decided to do some shopping. John saw me and called my name, then marched right up to me and very aggressively said \"You **need** to turn the captions off when you're done in the break room.\"\n\nMe: \"That's very [ableist](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism) of you to say, John.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn off the captions.\"\n\nMe: \"John, I'm shopping right now.\"\n\nThen I turned around and walked off to finish getting groceries.\n\nWhen I clocked in this past Monday, I immediately went to HR and told them that I was being intimidated by a coworker because of my disability. They said that they would follow up. I believe they left before they were able to talk to him.\n\nAt my store we announce when we are going to break over our radios so that people know if they need to watch that area. After I announced that I was going on lunch, I went to the break room and saw John's stuff sitting across from where I usually sit \\(by the TV so I can hear better\\), and immediately sat farther away near a coworker.\n\nShe told me that just before I got there John was ranting to a new coworker of ours that I always turn on the captions but that he wasn't going to let me, so he was going to hide the remote.\n\nI looked around and noticed that the remote was indeed missing. I was furious, so I got up to go talk to his immediate supervisor because this is absolutely ridiculous. I passed by John, who was putting something in his locker, and he sneered at me, saying, \"Looking for something, Carly?\"\n\nI didn't respond, but just walked past him and talked to his supervisor, who said he would talk to him. I also told my boss, and wrote down an account of what happened to give to HR.\n\nWhen I went back in to the break room I sat by my coworker again, and was talking with her. John kept trying to make conversation but I purposefully didn't look at him so I couldn't read his lips, but I was able to hear him say \"What, can she not hear me or something?\"\n\nHe sounded genuinely surprised that the Hard of Hearing girl who needs Closed Captioning might not be able to hear him, and even more surprised that I didn't want to talk to him after he purposefully hid the remote from me.\n\nLiterally Closed Captioning is just such an odd thing to be so violently opposed to, and he is probably the most \"Think Hearing\" person I've ever had the displeasure to work with. It's almost impressive how clueless he is.\n\nI had yesterday off, but will be working tonight. I'm curious what HR has to say, if they are there this evening.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I am honestly just astonished by this aggressive behavior.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot to tell you guys the best part of this entire situation! He doesn't even *watch* the TV most of the time. I've seen him turn off the CC or change the channel \\(without asking anyone else in the break room, he'll just grab the remote and change it\\), and then he will sit with his back to the TV and watch videos on his phone with the volume all the way up. He did this once when a *commercial* for American Idol came on, just grabbed the remote and changed the channel. I asked him why he changed the channel without asking and he just said \"I hate American Idol,\" and then turned around and watched videos on his phone, so I don't know what his deal is.  \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/8llwj8/workplace_bully_wont_let_me_have_cc/dzhlae0/) </author: Carlyndra>\n<author: Carlyndra indent=1> Update: I just got home from work.  \n\nI talked to HR again, and they said they were going to talk to John. John is now no longer allowed to speak to me in any capacity, and if I'm able to I'm allowed to try to take my breaks at different times than him.  \n\nI pushed my HR for more info, and they said they are partnering with the person one step above them, but if John doesn't say or do anything else, then this is the end of it, and they aren't going to pursue any further corrective action.   </author: Carlyndra>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: pilotavery toEvalutate=true/>\n    From what you've explained, I don't think he's going to last very long.\n   </ author: pilotavery/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

However, none of these people turn on the CC themselves, the just prefer it when it's already on, so I am the only one who switches it on.\n\nA few weeks ago I was on one of my breaks watching TV with CC when John walks up to me and says very firmly, \"Hey Carly, you need to turn the captions off when you're done.\"\n\nMe: \"Why?\"\n\nJohn: \"You're the only person in this store who has problems with their ears, so you need to turn the captions off.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not the only one who is Hard of Hearing in this store, there are other people who needs captions.\" \\(\\(At this time there were two other people who also identified as Hard of Hearing\\)\\)\n\nJohn: \"Oh yeah, who?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not outing people's medical conditions to you.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn the captions off.\"\n\nIt was a very odd interaction.\n\nSomething similar happened the next week, but this time I was sitting with two other people, and the entire time John was telling me that I need to turn off the captions, the other two were telling him that they wanted the captions on, but he absolutely didn't listen to them.\n\nLast week I was clocked out for lunch so I decided to do some shopping. John saw me and called my name, then marched right up to me and very aggressively said \"You **need** to turn the captions off when you're done in the break room.\"\n\nMe: \"That's very [ableist](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism) of you to say, John.\"\n\nJohn: \"Turn off the captions.\"\n\nMe: \"John, I'm shopping right now.\"\n\nThen I turned around and walked off to finish getting groceries.\n\nWhen I clocked in this past Monday, I immediately went to HR and told them that I was being intimidated by a coworker because of my disability. They said that they would follow up. I believe they left before they were able to talk to him.\n\nAt my store we announce when we are going to break over our radios so that people know if they need to watch that area. After I announced that I was going on lunch, I went to the break room and saw John's stuff sitting across from where I usually sit \\(by the TV so I can hear better\\), and immediately sat farther away near a coworker.\n\nShe told me that just before I got there John was ranting to a new coworker of ours that I always turn on the captions but that he wasn't going to let me, so he was going to hide the remote.\n\nI looked around and noticed that the remote was indeed missing. I was furious, so I got up to go talk to his immediate supervisor because this is absolutely ridiculous. I passed by John, who was putting something in his locker, and he sneered at me, saying, \"Looking for something, Carly?\"\n\nI didn't respond, but just walked past him and talked to his supervisor, who said he would talk to him. I also told my boss, and wrote down an account of what happened to give to HR.\n\nWhen I went back in to the break room I sat by my coworker again, and was talking with her. John kept trying to make conversation but I purposefully didn't look at him so I couldn't read his lips, but I was able to hear him say \"What, can she not hear me or something?\"\n\nHe sounded genuinely surprised that the Hard of Hearing girl who needs Closed Captioning might not be able to hear him, and even more surprised that I didn't want to talk to him after he purposefully hid the remote from me.\n\nLiterally Closed Captioning is just such an odd thing to be so violently opposed to, and he is probably the most \"Think Hearing\" person I've ever had the displeasure to work with. It's almost impressive how clueless he is.\n\nI had yesterday off, but will be working tonight. I'm curious what HR has to say, if they are there this evening.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I am honestly just astonished by this aggressive behavior.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot to tell you guys the best part of this entire situation! He doesn't even *watch* the TV most of the time. I've seen him turn off the CC or change the channel \\(without asking anyone else in the break room, he'll just grab the remote and change it\\), and then he will sit with his back to the TV and watch videos on his phone with the volume all the way up. He did this once when a *commercial* for American Idol came on, just grabbed the remote and changed the channel. I asked him why he changed the channel without asking and he just said \"I hate American Idol,\" and then turned around and watched videos on his phone, so I don't know what his deal is.  \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/8llwj8/workplace_bully_wont_let_me_have_cc/dzhlae0/) </author: Carlyndra>\n<author: Carlyndra indent=1> Update: I just got home from work.  \n\nI talked to HR again, and they said they were going to talk to John.

I work for a big box retail store. In our break room we have a television. I don't have a smartphone, but everyone else does, so I am typically the only one watching the TV.\n\nI always turn on Closed Captioning so I can understand what's going on, especially since there is a lot  of other noise \\(people talking, watching videos on their phones without headphones, loud box fans because it's hot\\).\n\nThere is an individual, who I'm going to call \"John,\" who hates Closed Captioning for some reason.\n\nI never turn off CC when my break is over.

I was trying to ask if they specifically want open captions only or if something like rear window captioning might be an acceptable alternative but they blocked me before I finished writing the question. \n\nI framed the question by explaining that on-screen captions plus camera movement can trigger my motion sickness, bc I was trying to Illustrate that open captions on all movies always might be more than a preference issue for some ppl, but they might have just assumed I was being stupid or argumentative or trolling. Which is fine. I am indeed stupid a lot and no one has to read my thoughts or answer my questions. \n\nBut I'm more concerned that there's maybe something about my question that was legitimately offensive. I tried googling it, but the only thing seems to be that rear window is prohibitively expensive so maybe that's not accessible if it can't be available equally? Or is open captioning preferred by the Deaf community bc it's very visible and automatic rather than just being an option ppl have to specifically seek out or try to find? Or some other reason? \n\nI genuinely want to learn people's opinions and perspectives. Im totally not passionate about rear window captioning or even movies and television at all. I'm not invested in the answer either way, but I do want to avoid being unintentionally hurtful or dismissive in the future and learn more about the topic in general. </author: iamasecretthrowaway>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: surdophobe toEvalutate=true/>\n    OK first of all rear-window captioning was a film-only thing. It went away about 11 years ago in the digital conversion. So please consider that in your search you are looking at very old data and very old arguments and obsolete restrictions against that data. \n\nBack then the only way for an open captioned movie to exist was to take a physical copy of the movie and use a laser to permanently etch the captions onto the film.  But now, every single theater and every single copy of the movie can be viewed with open captions. It just a matter of the projector operators loading into their equipment that way.  \n\n>I framed the question by explaining that on-screen captions plus camera movement can trigger my motion sickness,\n\nThat's quite a dubious claim, to be honest. I too would assume you were making shit up to be argumentive. \n\n>But I'm more concerned that there's maybe something about my question that was legitimately offensive.\n\nYou are extremely ill-informed about how bad the problem has been for the last 10+ years.  The tech that replaced rear-window captioning has been abysmal.

I was trying to ask if they specifically want open captions only or if something like rear window captioning might be an acceptable alternative but they blocked me before I finished writing the question. \n\nI framed the question by explaining that on-screen captions plus camera movement can trigger my motion sickness, bc I was trying to Illustrate that open captions on all movies always might be more than a preference issue for some ppl, but they might have just assumed I was being stupid or argumentative or trolling. Which is fine. I am indeed stupid a lot and no one has to read my thoughts or answer my questions. \n\nBut I'm more concerned that there's maybe something about my question that was legitimately offensive. I tried googling it, but the only thing seems to be that rear window is prohibitively expensive so maybe that's not accessible if it can't be available equally? Or is open captioning preferred by the Deaf community bc it's very visible and automatic rather than just being an option ppl have to specifically seek out or try to find? Or some other reason? \n\nI genuinely want to learn people's opinions and perspectives. Im totally not passionate about rear window captioning or even movies and television at all. I'm not invested in the answer either way, but I do want to avoid being unintentionally hurtful or dismissive in the future and learn more about the topic in general. </author: iamasecretthrowaway>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: surdophobe toEvalutate=true/>\n    OK first of all rear-window captioning was a film-only thing.

Recently, she did a round of interviews with right-wing media outlets, where she communicated in ASL with interpreters.\n\nHere are couple of interviews:\n\n[BlazeTV Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNSzVw_GX5c)\n\n[The Daily Moth's coverage with another interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bZPlgJ2q-4)\n\nThis caught the attention of the notorious deaf vlogger, Ricky Taylor. \n\nHe spoke about this with some people in the deaf community and someone recognized her. That someone told him her real name. \n\nRicky made a Threads post where he named DataRepublican\u2019s real identity\u2014Jennica Pounds\u2014which set off a firestorm on social media. Jennica responded with the following Twitter post:\n\n>I have been doxxed. Rather than let others control the narrative, I am addressing this directly.\n\n>My name is Jennica Pounds. I recently resigned from my job to pursue DOGE-adjacent efforts full-time. While my background check is still in progress, my ultimate goal is to work with the Administration to cut waste and improve efficiency.\n\n>What began as a side hobby became a mission when I uncovered the role of NGOs in these issues. This is not about left or right. This is about us\u2014the people.\n\n>I gave up everything for this\u2014my safety, my career\u2014because I believe in what I am doing.\n\n>I am 100% Deaf and nonverbal. My lack of signing fluency does not make me any less Deaf. It is a result of a language impairment related to my autism called expressive dysphasia, which affects my ability to construct language fluently in real-time. This impacts my signing, speaking, and even writing, though writing allows me more time to correct mistakes. My interpreter and I spend hours refining my talking points to ensure she conveys what I mean, not just what I say.\n\n>I am Deaf. And being Deaf is not, and should never be, defined by one\u2019s signing ability, particularly when there are medical conditions involved.\n\n>I do not believe the Deaf community should be politically aligned with any party. A priority of mine has always been holding the Administration accountable to Deaf Americans, including advocating for policy changes such as allowing a second interpreter camera stream on television broadcasts. I will continue using my platform to push for these necessary changes.\u201d\n\nHer post triggered a wave of MAGA supporters (mostly hearing people) who brigaded Ricky Taylor\u2019s latest vlog about USAID, posting his home address, descriptions of his house and car, and threats against him\u2014literally doxxing him.\n\nRicky responded in a hilariously defiant way, mocking them. \n\nThen, lo and behold, [Rolling Stone published an article about Jennica Pounds](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/elon-musk-data-republican-anonymous-data-expert-doge-tech-1235280817/). The article referenced a \u201cdeaf man\u201d who named her\u2014obviously referring to Ricky.\n\nThe Rolling Stone article was brutal in its criticism of Jennica\u2019s role in spreading misinformation, which has been used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling key government functions.

Many in the deaf community mocked her signing in the interview videos and even questioned whether she was actually deaf.\n\nIf you know me, you know I despise when people\u2014usually \u201cD\u201d Deaf community members\u2014judge deaf people with below-average ASL skills as \u2018not real Deaf.\u2019\n\nJennica explained that she is a nonverbal autistic deaf person. I\u2019ve met nonverbal autistic deaf people before, and I value them as part of our community. Just because her ASL isn\u2019t fluent or native doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not deaf. I see Jennica as one of us.\n\n#However\u2026\n\nThat said, I have zero sympathy for her role as a data/software engineer being used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling critical government functions that serve and protect disabled people\u2014all of us here.\n\nJennica claims Ricky doxxed her. That\u2019s bullshit. \n\nShe did public interviews showing her face. Yes, she wore sunglasses, but let\u2019s be real\u2014sunglasses aren\u2019t a disguise.\n\nShe was already newsworthy in the deaf community for being a deaf data/software engineer praised by Elon Musk and Charlie Kirk. She boasted about their praise on her website. She also made it publicly known she was joining DOGE.\n\nIt was inevitable that deaf people would start talking and someone would recognize her. Our community is too small for it not to happen.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Rolling Stone\u2019s article. Her endeavors with \"DataRepublicans\" were public enough to attract the attention from a major publication company. They went way deeper in exposing her background. Their criticism of Jennica was completely valid. That article was coming out regardless of Ricky's post. \n\nBy choosing to align herself with this effort, Jennica should have expected public scrutiny.\n\n#In Conclusion\u2026\n\nRicky did nothing wrong by naming her. It was going to happen anyway.\n\nAnd it\u2019s beyond hypocritical for right-wingers to accuse him of doxxing when they literally doxxed Ricky.\n\nSo here we are\u2014a deaf person in our community has aligned herself with an administration that is actively working against us. </author: HelensScarletFever>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: killerbrain toEvalutate=true/>\n    You said it well. It's extremely sad and pathetic that Jennica is assisting the same people working to destroy all the services she benefited from. She should not be attacked for her signing skills.

Recently, she did a round of interviews with right-wing media outlets, where she communicated in ASL with interpreters.\n\nHere are couple of interviews:\n\n[BlazeTV Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNSzVw_GX5c)\n\n[The Daily Moth's coverage with another interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bZPlgJ2q-4)\n\nThis caught the attention of the notorious deaf vlogger, Ricky Taylor. \n\nHe spoke about this with some people in the deaf community and someone recognized her. That someone told him her real name. \n\nRicky made a Threads post where he named DataRepublican\u2019s real identity\u2014Jennica Pounds\u2014which set off a firestorm on social media. Jennica responded with the following Twitter post:\n\n>I have been doxxed. Rather than let others control the narrative, I am addressing this directly.\n\n>My name is Jennica Pounds.

That\u2019s bullshit. \n\nShe did public interviews showing her face. Yes, she wore sunglasses, but let\u2019s be real\u2014sunglasses aren\u2019t a disguise.\n\nShe was already newsworthy in the deaf community for being a deaf data/software engineer praised by Elon Musk and Charlie Kirk. She boasted about their praise on her website. She also made it publicly known she was joining DOGE.\n\nIt was inevitable that deaf people would start talking and someone would recognize her. Our community is too small for it not to happen.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Rolling Stone\u2019s article. Her endeavors with \"DataRepublicans\" were public enough to attract the attention from a major publication company. They went way deeper in exposing her background. Their criticism of Jennica was completely valid. That article was coming out regardless of Ricky's post. \n\nBy choosing to align herself with this effort, Jennica should have expected public scrutiny.\n\n#In Conclusion\u2026\n\nRicky did nothing wrong by naming her. It was going to happen anyway.\n\nAnd it\u2019s beyond hypocritical for right-wingers to accuse him of doxxing when they literally doxxed Ricky.\n\nSo here we are\u2014a deaf person in our community has aligned herself with an administration that is actively working against us. </author: HelensScarletFever>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: killerbrain toEvalutate=true/>\n    You said it well. It's extremely sad and pathetic that Jennica is assisting the same people working to destroy all the services she benefited from. She should not be attacked for her signing skills. She SHOULD be attacked for selling her community out. She, too, will find herself as fucked as the rest of us when she's no longer useful to this group.\n   </ author: killerbrain/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s an app I can download for my phone. I\u2019m going to the movies next week. I don\u2019t go often and I really don\u2019t want to have to ask for the closed caption device. TIA!  </author: alittlefaith530>\n<author: Kuildeous indent=1> Why not the closed caption device? Is it the fear of battery power? I had that situation with one theatre where twice the device ran out of juice. I suspect that it's negligent employees not fully charging them, but the owner said that he would investigate. Sometimes batteries go bad, so maybe he needs to replace them. \n\nI would be curious about a phone app because there's very little I can imagine that wouldn't intrude on other people's viewing pleasure, unlike the closed caption devices. \n\nAlso, caption algorithms have a long ways to go, so I would only trust professionally transcribed captions. \n\nI may check out Live Transcribe for those older movies that don't have captions loaded. </author: Kuildeous>\n<author: alittlefaith530 indent=2> That is a very good point about the phone. \n\nIt\u2019s fear of taking it away from someone who might need it more than I do. I have moderate/severe (almost profound) loss but only in one ear. I can and have managed, but for this movie I would prefer to get all of the dialog. The device would greatly help me but I wouldn\u2019t want to take it from someone who needs it more than I do. </author: alittlefaith530>\n<author: Kuildeous indent=3> That's considerate of you. From my experience, I haven't see these caption devices run out. I suppose it could be worth waiting until 5 minutes before the movie and then check in with them if they have one available. \n\nBut hearing loss is hearing loss. If you need captions to fully understand the movie, I don't think we can really say you're less deserving of this assistance than others. \n\nEspecially since movies nowadays are so freakin' loud that dialogue gets swallowed up more often than not. \n\nI've seen some theatres offer open captions for select viewings. I may have to give that a try. Still not a common occurrence, so good luck finding one of those. </author: Kuildeous>\n<author: alittlefaith530 indent=4> Thank you. That means a lot to me.

The problem with OIC Movies is that most of their videos are not publicly available and not all of the videos have captions. I hope there are public ASL talks in the form of TED talks with accurate translations. Any pointers on such collections of videos? </author: Zia_0216>\n<author: [deleted] indent=1> If you want TED Talks by deaf people, this playlist has a lot. Some are by signers, and some are not. I see some that seem to be by hearing people talking about deaf people (like technology for the deaf/hoh). \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA17E58E99C442771 \n\nIf those aren\u2019t to your satisfaction, let us know what else you\u2019re looking for, so we can find better videos. I also enjoy Melmira, which is a show that\u2019s more focused on human stories and lifestyles, so it\u2019s more interview-heavy, but interesting to me.

I think I\u2019ll spend a lot of time on them. I\u2019m probably asking for too much. Do you know where I can find more videos that have only one narrators / signers sitting in the center?

Ally says \"No, I walked with Rob.\"\n\nShe seems to make the \"R\" symbol and tap it on her cheek. Can someone explain how this signifies \"Rob?\"\n\nRob is a classmate, and seems to be possibly her boyfriend (I've only seen 8 minutes of this movie) if that helps.\n\nI was just curious how this shorthand works. </author: EarthAllAlong>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: GG-Gdog toEvalutate=true/>\n    If you\u2019re looking for a film with a better representation of sign language, I would give A Quiet Place (also on Netflix). It\u2019s a much better film and they actually do a decent job of representing sign language and one person\u2019s experience of being Deaf. It\u2019s also jus a good movie. \nIn general, be wary of using commercial films as a sign language teacher. They\u2019re not always as accurate as they should be and as people want them to be.

We (the network) would like to create a show in which the deaf community is our first priority. We will have the characters use American sign language to communicate. However, I'd also like to know what you (the deaf community) feel is missing in television when it comes to making your experience more enjoyable while consuming content. Please let me know what you would like to see more of in television! The more details, the better. </author: underthemoonlight08>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: Distracted-by-Shiny toEvalutate=true/>\n    Accurate captions - the absolute #1 thing\n\nMaybe show how hearing people can communicate with deaf by using phone apps\n\nMaybe show the pros and cons of interactions with and without hearing aids\n\nIf it\u2019s America, you can show how awful our medical system, employment, & disability is for deaf people. \n\nMaybe show a combination of hearing and deaf people. Deaf people are part of the world.\n\nMy first thought about a Sci Fi deaf show is how scary being in the dark is if you can\u2019t hear.\n\nIt sucks to be in the dark. I try not to go out at night.\n\nMy son likes to sneak up and scare me for fun after I go to bed. It\u2019s kinda a fun game we play. I can\u2019t hear him sneaking in the dark but I look for visual cues. He\u2019s gotten me real good a couple of times.\n\nI\u2019m an easy scare at haunted houses.\n\nOn the plus side, I have excellent visual memory and can tell you if something has moved or where it was last seen. It\u2019s like detective show accurate. If it\u2019s moved an inch, I\u2019ve noticed.\n   </ author: Distracted-by-Shiny/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

Can someone explain how this signifies \"Rob?\"\n\nRob is a classmate, and seems to be possibly her boyfriend (I've only seen 8 minutes of this movie) if that helps.\n\nI was just curious how this shorthand works. </author: EarthAllAlong>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: GG-Gdog toEvalutate=true/>\n    If you\u2019re looking for a film with a better representation of sign language, I would give A Quiet Place (also on Netflix). It\u2019s a much better film and they actually do a decent job of representing sign language and one person\u2019s experience of being Deaf. It\u2019s also jus a good movie. \nIn general, be wary of using commercial films as a sign language teacher. They\u2019re not always as accurate as they should be and as people want them to be.

We (the network) would like to create a show in which the deaf community is our first priority. We will have the characters use American sign language to communicate. However, I'd also like to know what you (the deaf community) feel is missing in television when it comes to making your experience more enjoyable while consuming content. Please let me know what you would like to see more of in television! The more details, the better. </author: underthemoonlight08>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: Distracted-by-Shiny toEvalutate=true/>\n    Accurate captions - the absolute #1 thing\n\nMaybe show how hearing people can communicate with deaf by using phone apps\n\nMaybe show the pros and cons of interactions with and without hearing aids\n\nIf it\u2019s America, you can show how awful our medical system, employment, & disability is for deaf people. \n\nMaybe show a combination of hearing and deaf people. Deaf people are part of the world.\n\nMy first thought about a Sci Fi deaf show is how scary being in the dark is if you can\u2019t hear.\n\nIt sucks to be in the dark. I try not to go out at night.\n\nMy son likes to sneak up and scare me for fun after I go to bed. It\u2019s kinda a fun game we play. I can\u2019t hear him sneaking in the dark but I look for visual cues. He\u2019s gotten me real good a couple of times.\n\nI\u2019m an easy scare at haunted houses.\n\nOn the plus side, I have excellent visual memory and can tell you if something has moved or where it was last seen. It\u2019s like detective show accurate. If it\u2019s moved an inch, I\u2019ve noticed.\n   </ author: Distracted-by-Shiny/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!

The goal of the prediction is to evalute the person as an earlyvangelist according to the book \"The Four Steps To The Epiphany\", the labels. are a bit different from the book. Because the labels are more aligned to the data source Reddit and the types of conversations people have on Reddit. </category_description>\n<labels_to_predict>YOU CAN PICK MULTIPLE LABELS IF IT APPLIES\nproblem_description: The Redditor, describes a problem that it faces, reason: Explain the reasoning in a single sentence of why you labeled this variable with True/False\nfrustration_expression: The Redditor, expresses a frustration towards something. It is an emotional reaction, reason: Explain the reasoning in a single sentence of why you labeled this variable with True/False\nsolution_seeking: The Redditor is actively looking for a solution, to aliviate a problem or frustration., reason: Explain the reasoning in a single sentence of why you labeled this variable with True/False\nsolution_attempted: The Redditor describes a solution that partially or completly solved a problem that they faced. , reason: Explain the reasoning in a single sentence of why you labeled this variable with True/False\nsolution_proposing: The Redditor recommends a partial or complete solution to another person to solve a problem that the other person has. , reason: Explain the reasoning in a single sentence of why you labeled this variable with True/False\nwilling_to_spend: The Redditor shows a clear willingness to pay to solve a problem, buy a product, have someone fix it for them, buy a subscription.  , reason: Explain the reasoning in a single sentence of why you labeled this variable with True/False\n</labels_to_predict>\n\n    ### ConversationThread\n    <author: EarthAllAlong indent=0> post_title: Question about a sign in the netflix movie The Silence\nAt about 8 minutes in, the mother asks Ally whether she walked alone. Ally says \"No, I walked with Rob.\"\n\nShe seems to make the \"R\" symbol and tap it on her cheek. Can someone explain how this signifies \"Rob?\"\n\nRob is a classmate, and seems to be possibly her boyfriend (I've only seen 8 minutes of this movie) if that helps.\n\nI was just curious how this shorthand works. </author: EarthAllAlong>\n\n\n    ### RedditMessage to evaluate\n    < author: GG-Gdog toEvalutate=true/>\n    If you\u2019re looking for a film with a better representation of sign language, I would give A Quiet Place (also on Netflix). It\u2019s a much better film and they actually do a decent job of representing sign language and one person\u2019s experience of being Deaf. It\u2019s also jus a good movie. \nIn general, be wary of using commercial films as a sign language teacher. They\u2019re not always as accurate as they should be and as people want them to be. But I hope you enjoy the movie regardless!\n   </ author: GG-Gdog/>\n\n### EXPECTED OUTPUT IN JSON!
