I need a truly quiet environment with no distractions to understand what someone is saying, it would also be easier if an automated machine is speaking or that person speaks really clearly and a bit slower. Visual guides also help me but captions help me GREATLY in understanding a video. Most automated captions are absolute garbage. Abuse rarely happens, I don't see why you would remove community subtitles when it RARELY happens. \\\"The feature is rarely used\\\" and?? Are you just going to ignore people who rely on community captions because it is \\\"rarely used\\\"? Sure it may not matter to many others, but it matters to me and others who rely on captions. If you want to be more accessible, LISTEN to the people that you're trying to include. Don't assume what's accessible and what's not. I honestly don't understand why YT would do such a thing. Messed up captions are still better than automated captions. So what if the captions contain jokes or maybe comments? It's better than not understanding at all what the person is saying.

The article referenced a \\u201cdeaf man\\u201d who named her\\u2014obviously referring to Ricky.\\n\\nThe Rolling Stone article was brutal in its criticism of Jennica\\u2019s role in spreading misinformation, which has been used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling key government functions. It also revealed details about her husband, home, distillery business, employment history, and a company she registered in Utah. Basically, it was a takedown piece.\\n\\nFYI - I heard Rolling Stone had been working on this article for a while, intending to be the first to expose Jennica\\u2019s identity\\u2014but Ricky beat them to it. That led to Rolling Stone reaching out to Ricky before publication, hence the vague reference to a \\u201cdeaf man\\u201d who named her.\\n\\nAlso the timing of this post is really perfect because today [The New York Times published a full list of DOGE staffers](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/27/us/politics/doge-staff-list.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare). \\n\\nMAGA supporters are now crying about doxxing\\u2014the same way they did when Ricky exposed Jennica. But there\\u2019s plenty of online discussion about how these people are on the government payroll, impacting American citizens, meaning their identities should be public.\\n\\n#My Take on This Drama\\n\\n***My Sympathy for Jennica***\\n\\nFirst, I want to address the backlash Jennica faced over her ASL skills. Many in the deaf community mocked her signing in the interview videos and even questioned whether she was actually deaf.\\n\\nIf you know me, you know I despise when people\\u2014usually \\u201cD\\u201d Deaf community members\\u2014judge deaf people with below-average ASL skills as \\u2018not real Deaf.\\u2019\\n\\nJennica explained that she is a nonverbal autistic deaf person. I\\u2019ve met nonverbal autistic deaf people before, and I value them as part of our community. Just because her ASL isn\\u2019t fluent or native doesn\\u2019t mean she\\u2019s not deaf. I see Jennica as one of us.\\n\\n#However\\u2026\\n\\nThat said, I have zero sympathy for her role as a data/software engineer being used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling critical government functions that serve and protect disabled people\\u2014all of us here.\\n\\nJennica claims Ricky doxxed her. That\\u2019s bullshit. \\n\\nShe did public interviews showing her face. Yes, she wore sunglasses, but let\\u2019s be real\\u2014sunglasses aren\\u2019t a disguise.\\n\\nShe was already newsworthy in the deaf community for being a deaf data/software engineer praised by Elon Musk and Charlie Kirk. She boasted about their praise on her website. She also made it publicly known she was joining DOGE.\\n\\nIt was inevitable that deaf people would start talking and someone would recognize her. Our community is too small for it not to happen.\\n\\nAnd let\\u2019s not forget Rolling Stone\\u2019s article. Her endeavors with \\\"DataRepublicans\\\" were public enough to attract the attention from a major publication company. They went way deeper in exposing her background. Their criticism of Jennica was completely valid. That article was coming out regardless of Ricky's post. \\n\\nBy choosing to align herself with this effort, Jennica should have expected public scrutiny.\\n\\n#In Conclusion\\u2026\\n\\nRicky did nothing wrong by naming her. It was going to happen anyway.\\n\\nAnd it\\u2019s beyond hypocritical for right-wingers to accuse him of doxxing when they literally doxxed Ricky.\\n\\nSo here we are\\u2014a deaf person in our community has aligned herself with an administration that is actively working against us.\",\n",
    "            \"You said it well. It's extremely sad and pathetic that Jennica is assisting the same people working to destroy all the services she benefited from. She should not be attacked for her signing skills. She SHOULD be attacked for selling her community out. She, too, will find herself as fucked as the rest of us when she's no longer useful to this group.\",\n",

That led to Rolling Stone reaching out to Ricky before publication, hence the vague reference to a \\u201cdeaf man\\u201d who named her.\\n\\nAlso the timing of this post is really perfect because today [The New York Times published a full list of DOGE staffers](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/27/us/politics/doge-staff-list.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare). \\n\\nMAGA supporters are now crying about doxxing\\u2014the same way they did when Ricky exposed Jennica. But there\\u2019s plenty of online discussion about how these people are on the government payroll, impacting American citizens, meaning their identities should be public.\\n\\n#My Take on This Drama\\n\\n***My Sympathy for Jennica***\\n\\nFirst, I want to address the backlash Jennica faced over her ASL skills. Many in the deaf community mocked her signing in the interview videos and even questioned whether she was actually deaf.\\n\\nIf you know me, you know I despise when people\\u2014usually \\u201cD\\u201d Deaf community members\\u2014judge deaf people with below-average ASL skills as \\u2018not real Deaf.\\u2019\\n\\nJennica explained that she is a nonverbal autistic deaf person. I\\u2019ve met nonverbal autistic deaf people before, and I value them as part of our community. Just because her ASL isn\\u2019t fluent or native doesn\\u2019t mean she\\u2019s not deaf. I see Jennica as one of us.\\n\\n#However\\u2026\\n\\nThat said, I have zero sympathy for her role as a data/software engineer being used by Elon Musk and Republicans to justify dismantling critical government functions that serve and protect disabled people\\u2014all of us here.\\n\\nJennica claims Ricky doxxed her. That\\u2019s bullshit. \\n\\nShe did public interviews showing her face. Yes, she wore sunglasses, but let\\u2019s be real\\u2014sunglasses aren\\u2019t a disguise.\\n\\nShe was already newsworthy in the deaf community for being a deaf data/software engineer praised by Elon Musk and Charlie Kirk. She boasted about their praise on her website. She also made it publicly known she was joining DOGE.\\n\\nIt was inevitable that deaf people would start talking and someone would recognize her. Our community is too small for it not to happen.\\n\\nAnd let\\u2019s not forget Rolling Stone\\u2019s article. Her endeavors with \\\"DataRepublicans\\\" were public enough to attract the attention from a major publication company. They went way deeper in exposing her background. Their criticism of Jennica was completely valid. That article was coming out regardless of Ricky's post. \\n\\nBy choosing to align herself with this effort, Jennica should have expected public scrutiny.\\n\\n#In Conclusion\\u2026\\n\\nRicky did nothing wrong by naming her. It was going to happen anyway.\\n\\nAnd it\\u2019s beyond hypocritical for right-wingers to accuse him of doxxing when they literally doxxed Ricky.\\n\\nSo here we are\\u2014a deaf person in our community has aligned herself with an administration that is actively working against us.\",\n",
    "            \"You said it well. It's extremely sad and pathetic that Jennica is assisting the same people working to destroy all the services she benefited from. She should not be attacked for her signing skills. She SHOULD be attacked for selling her community out. She, too, will find herself as fucked as the rest of us when she's no longer useful to this group.\",\n",
    "            \"I know her personally, she is nice person but she probably doesn\\u2019t care about the administration working against the community because she finally became part of it recently. Her life she was never part of it and that didn\\u2019t impact her.\\n\\nAnd she\\u2019s rich. Not filthy rich, but comfortable rich.\"\n",

    "            \"NAD is in the Toilet\\nHi, r/deaf! Helen here!\\n\\nI have a deaf audience here that doesn\\u2019t use ASL as their primary language and isn\\u2019t deeply connected to the big \\u201cD\\u201d Deaf community. So I\\u2019d like to start off with a short and very basic statement on what \\u201cNAD\\u201d is.\\n\\nNAD is the \\u201cNational Association of the Deaf.\\u201d It prides itself on being the oldest civil rights organization in our nation. NAD has basically been at the front of civil rights advancements for the deaf since the late 1800s.\\n\\nWant to learn more about NAD? Internet magic will take you places.\\n\\nAnd\\u2026\\n\\nIt now seems like NAD is going to collapse.\\n\\nYeah. It really does look like NAD is on its knees right now and may actually fall as an organization.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s significant buzz in the community surrounding NAD\\u2019s board right now.\\n\\nThis buzz around the NAD board has actually been an ongoing thing since the 2024 Super Bowl fiasco. But I\\u2019d say it was late this past July when the deaf community finally turned their heads toward NAD and began saying, \\u201cHey, what the fuck is going on with you?\\u201d after they pulled that dumb stunt of announcing Kelby Brick as their sole NAD candidate as if they had committed a crime.\\n\\nJust today, I went ahead and scrolled through r/deaf to see if there\\u2019s any talk about this. I got as far back as three weeks and didn\\u2019t see anything.\\n\\nAlrighty, I\\u2019m here to fix that.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s begin.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#Kelby Brick is the Heir Apparent\\n\\n---\\n\\nWe all know that Howard Rosenblum left NAD over a year ago.\\n\\n(Author\\u2019s note: Howard is currently running for Congress, FYI. Also, I still have an axe to grind over why he resigned. I\\u2019ve thought about writing a post dedicated to that topic for a long time, but I didn\\u2019t because it\\u2019s kind of old news. But if you\\u2019d like to read my thoughts about this, please comment. I\\u2019ll make a post covering it if there\\u2019s interest.)\\n\\nBobbie Beth Scoggins was tapped to take over the reins of NAD as interim CEO not long after Howard\\u2019s departure.\\n\\nBobbie was NAD\\u2019s president for several years at some point in the past two decades. Some people in the community think Bobbie was the last great NAD president. I was a young adult at the time and far more concerned with getting drunk and high than paying attention to NAD, so I don\\u2019t really have a strong opinion about Bobbie one way or another. I do, however, remember the drama at the end of her term in 2012, when Chris Wagner and Sheri Farinha were vying for her vacancy.\\n\\nWith Bobbie in the interim CEO role, NAD launched a search committee for the next permanent CEO.\\n\\nThey announced the results of their CEO search process on July 28. You can watch[ it in its full glory here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fpoC_sUpRo).\\n\\nOkay, let\\u2019s get a quick recap out of the way before discussing why this was a big deal.\\n\\nThe quick summary is that Kelby Brick is the sole candidate to be NAD\\u2019s next permanent CEO.\\n\\nHe is the current COO of NAD.\\n\\nKelby Brick has a law degree and founded Maryland\\u2019s Office for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, where he led the office for over 10 years. He left that role to join NAD as their COO.\\n\\nLook, Kelby Brick is no Howard Rosenblum. But he\\u2019s a perfectly fine candidate. A lot of deaf people like him. I think he\\u2019s a nice guy, although I\\u2019m more familiar with his wife than with him. I have nothing bad to say about him.\\n\\nThe deaf community also has no serious qualms about him becoming the next CEO.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#So What\\u2019s the Big Deal?\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe big deal was how NAD\\u2019s board announced Kelby Brick\\u2019s candidacy.\\n\\nFirst of all, an immediate concern was raised about how Kelby Brick is the sole candidate.\\n\\nIdeally, we\\u2019d like to see a few candidates running for the position to allow a real discussion on who we think would be the best choice to run the organization.\\n\\nWhen Howard Rosenblum ran for CEO, he was up against Shane Feldman and Darlene Zangara. In a perfect world, that\\u2019s what should be happening now in the search for the next CEO.\\n\\nHowever, I can let this part slide. We\\u2019re living in the most volatile political climate since the 1970s (if not ever). A lot of people are nervous about taking such a public-facing job that inevitably brings intense criticism and pressure.\\n\\nAnd it\\u2019s also obvious that having only one candidate isn\\u2019t the board\\u2019s fault. I believe it was mentioned that they had six applicants, and five of them dropped out. Anyone can drop out, and that\\u2019s not something we can hold the NAD board liable for.\\n\\nWhat set the community abuzz was the weird behavior from president Lisa Rose (and the board to some extent) when she announced Kelby\\u2019s candidacy.\\n\\nAt the Zoom meeting on the night of July 27 or 28, Lisa Rose announced they were going to play a pre-recorded video announcing the candidate. She then played the video.\\n\\nIn the video, Kelby Brick was introduced as the candidate. He gave a speech on his candidacy, followed by a Q&amp;A session with several board members asking him questions, which he answered.\\n\\nWhen the video ended, Lisa Rose came back on the pinned Zoom screen to thank everyone. She announced that the announcement video would be uploaded on NAD\\u2019s Facebook page until midnight that same day, and that a link to a survey would be provided for the community to fill out. The survey also had a midnight deadline.\\n\\nThen Lisa Rose abruptly ended the Zoom event with zero audience participation.\\n\\nAt the time the meeting concluded, the deaf community had just barely over three hours to watch the video and to fill out the survey.\\n\\nLisa Rose and the NAD board acted like they had done something wrong behind the scenes and were covering something up.\\n\\nIf they had simply hosted a meeting, announced that Kelby was the sole candidate, and explained that everyone else backed out except him, I\\u2019m confident most people would\\u2019ve been fine with it aside from one or two asking why there was only one candidate.\\n\\nInstead, their actions around the announcement were obviously designed to avoid any interaction with the community.\\n\\nI mean, seriously, why did they appear so afraid to face the community?\\n\\nThe deaf community reacted to the strange announcement instantly.\\n\\nThe most prominent reactions came from Tar Burt and Chris Haulmark.\\n\\nThe reaction was basically:\\n\\n\\u201cJust one candidate!? What happened to the other five applicants!?\\u201d\\\\\\n\\n\\u201cNever mind that. What the hell was that announcement!? No open session with the audience!?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThis pathetic excuse of a CEO announcement video is only going to be posted on Facebook for THREE HOURS!? And they\\u2019re closing the survey in THREE HOURS!?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!?\\u201d\\n\\nNAD quickly backtracked. Instead, they posted the announcement video we can still see on their Facebook page today.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#The Newly-Hired CFO\\u2019s Salary Is Coming Out of the Interim CEO\\u2019s Salary\\n\\n---\\n\\nOver the last two weeks, the deaf community has seen a rapid series of events from NAD that seem to point to the organization bleeding to death.\\n\\nThe first was interim CEO Bobbie Beth Scoggins\\u2019 [vlog](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1FJutCT8jN/) addressing the community on September 18.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s the summary:\\n\\nBobbie said that NAD has faced constant financial issues from the day she joined the organization as CEO. She literally said in her vlog that NAD is hemorrhaging money.\\n\\nShe explained that NAD had already cut a good number of staff before the start of the current fiscal year (April 1) to save money. Despite that, NAD still hasn\\u2019t stabilized financially over the last six months.\\n\\nThen Bobbie announced that NAD hired a CFO on September 1 to help with the organization\\u2019s financial instability. But there was a massive caveat.\\n\\nThe only way Bobbie made that possible was by taking a pay cut.\\n\\nNAD is using Bobbie\\u2019s pay cut to cover the CFO\\u2019s salary.\\n\\nWow.\\n\\nI mean, Bobbie isn\\u2019t the CEO of some massive organization pulling in tens of millions, who can toss away a million or two without blinking just to hire a finance person. I don\\u2019t have the exact numbers in front of me, but I\\u2019d bet her salary is in the very low six-figure range.\\n\\nIf I\\u2019m right, Bobbie\\u2019s salary would be completely reasonable for the scope of work she\\u2019s doing as CEO of a national organization for the deaf.\\n\\nAnd she\\u2026 and NAD\\u2026 had to cut her salary just to pay for the CFO\\u2019s job?\\n\\n---\\n\\n#Have You Heard About the \\u201cSuper Flag\\u201d?\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Super Flag is the largest U.S. flag.\\n\\nIt measures 225 feet high and 505 feet wide, and weighs 3,000 pounds.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s recognized by Guinness World Records as the largest U.S. flag.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not on continuous display, but it gets rented out for huge events like the Super Bowl and the World Series. Remember seeing a massive flag covering the entire field on TV? That\\u2019s the Super Flag.\\n\\nIt was even once hung vertically over the Hoover Dam. The goddamn thing nearly covered the entire dam.\\n\\nIf Bobbie\\u2019s salary cut isn\\u2019t a 225 feet high, 505 feet wide, and 3,000 pounds Super Red Flag to you, I don\\u2019t know what else to tell you.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#NAD is Now Frozen\\n\\n---\\n\\nSix days later\\u2026\\n\\nOn September 24, NAD released an announcement [vlog](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/177ZfGFqCJ/) by Jacob Leffler on their Facebook page. Jacob is NAD\\u2019s Chair of Governance.\\n\\nI\\u2019ll copy/paste the relevant quote from that Facebook post:\\n\\n&gt;Due to some internal issues, we have made the decision to temporarily pause Board meetings, decision-making within governance, and liaison/representation duties (including the CEO search and filling Board vacancies) until internal mediation and governance training is completed in order to strengthen our alignment with our fiduciary, legal, and ethical responsibilities.\\n\\n&gt;We have several internal matters that are currently being addressed through the Board\\u2019s established internal protocols and are being overseen by an independent subcommittee of the Governance Committee and in accordance with the NAD Bylaws and Board Policy Manual, with fairness and integrity at the forefront of all decisions and actions. Day-to-day NAD staff operations will continue without interruption under the direction of the Interim Chief Executive Officer. NAD remains fully committed to advancing its mission and serving the community.\\n\\n&gt;Out of respect for this process and to preserve the integrity of NAD\\u2019s governance, we ask our community members and outside parties to please respect our process, allow us the time and space to resolve our internal issues, and not to intervene or attempt to influence this internal process.\\n\\n&gt;Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.\\n\\nThis speaks for itself.\\n\\nNAD, as a national organization, has screeched to a complete halt.\\n\\nThey are now incapable of functioning as a charitable volunteer organization because it appears to be filled with people in high positions who don\\u2019t understand the basic functions and responsibilities they carry as representatives of NAD.\\n\\nIt also seems the board is caught in some kind of epic in-fighting.\\n\\nThis right here is a 225 feet high, 505 feet wide, and 3,000-pound Super Red Flag.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#The Community\\u2019s Reaction\\n\\n---\\n\\nI\\u2019m going to list all the vlogs I\\u2019ve seen emerge about this scandal.\\n\\n[Here is an open letter to NAD by Charleen Sculley, President of Nashville\\u2019s Chapter of the Tennessee Association of the Deaf.](https://www.facebook.com/scul.char/videos/1216813147133760/?rdid=ahv9rrGnacAcmhr8#)\\n\\n[The President of Indiana\\u2019s Association of the Deaf posted a YouTube video as a Region II state representative to NAD.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7_VNvmDH-A)\\n\\n[Kim Lucas, former President of the Utah Association of the Deaf, made a YouTube vlog about the chaos.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKQ7Au8iH9M)\\n\\nThere\\u2019s a guy on Facebook who made a couple of posts about NAD\\u2019s lack of transparency and called for Lisa Rose\\u2019s resignation. I can\\u2019t link his Facebook here for some reason, but you can find him by searching Christopher Merritt Patterson on Facebook.\\n\\nAll of these reactions were posted over the last few days.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#Chris Haulmark\\n\\n---\\n\\nChris is the one who has been posting about the NAD board\\u2019s poor conduct over the past year.\\n\\nLook up his name on Facebook to see all of his vlogs.\\n\\nChris has 11 vlogs on this topic going back to January of this year.\\n\\nAll of his vlogs are really long, with some reaching an hour in length.\\n\\nIf there is any one deaf person in the community addicted to smelling their own fart, it is Chris Haulmark.\\n\\nHis vlogs covering NAD\\u2019s incompetence are overly pedantic. He focuses way too much on the strict language of the organization\\u2019s bylaws and doesn\\u2019t really communicate the obvious, in-your-face incompetence of NAD\\u2019s board very well. He also often makes incorrect interpretations of the bylaws language.\\n\\nChris is completely obsessed with the term \\u201cultra vires.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cUltra vires\\u201d is a Latin term that literally means \\u201cbeyond the powers.\\u201d In law, it refers to actions taken by an individual or organization that go beyond the scope of authority granted to them.\\n\\nChris is not wrong to describe NAD in this way, but he comes across as someone who discovered this term and overuse it to make himself appear smart.\\n\\nOkay, Helen, you\\u2019re done with your Chris Haulmark rant now. Calm down. Move on.\\n\\nBut there is one thing Chris absolutely nails about the board\\u2019s conduct.\\n\\nThey are wrong for conducting so many of NAD\\u2019s mission and strategy decisions behind closed doors.\\n\\nNAD is a non-profit charitable organization. They are required to be completely transparent with what they are doing for the community.\\n\\nAnd they are not.\\n\\nThis is what Chris is correct about.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#In Conclusion\\u2026\\n\\n---\\n\\nI have so many things to say about how deeply frustrated I am with the widespread misunderstanding within the deaf community about how a non-profit charitable organization should be run.\\n\\nI\\u2019m particularly frustrated with the habit of people acting like serving on a non-profit is the same as serving on a secret cabal that should operate out of public view.\\n\\nAnyone who thinks this way is a fucking idiot.\\n\\nEverything a non-profit charitable organization does needs to be public knowledge.\\n\\nBut my post is already long enough. I\\u2019m also mentally and physically tired from writing this whole thing, so I\\u2019ll share my true thoughts on this in another post.\\n\\nFor now, I\\u2019d like to close by asking you to comment with your thoughts on this current scandal/chaos.\\n\\nLove,\\n\\nHelen\",\n",

Because all this happened during a pandemic, I never really had to confront what my new identity meant in the real world. At home, we use PSE, everything is quiet, Netflix is captioned, life is good. \\n\\nBut now I'm back at work and I somehow ended up in:\\n\\n-a group lunch\\n-with mostly people I didn't know\\n-everyone had accents from all around the world\\n-nobody knew I was deaf/hoh\\n\\nAnd--wait for it:\\n\\n-we were on a very windy rooftop \\n\\nI thought I was just meeting one person for a quiet lunch but things sort of devolved. I just really really realize now that I'm no longer a hearing person, but that I don't fit in to the broader disabled community either. I caught maybe 5% of the conversation, though that's probably only if I'm being generous.\\n\\nDo I laugh? Do I cry? Both?\\n\\nMostly I just needed to write it down, but any tips you have for navigating such situations (where you have little control over being in the situation in the first place) are appreciated. Honestly, I think I need an office-wide email about how to best communicate with me (the few people I do know here remember me as fully hearing). AKA face me, quiet location, speak slowly, etc. What do you think?\\n\\nETA: thank you all for your advice and comments. I love the support we can give each other on this thread.

(Severe in my right, moderate in my left). Naturally, my entire family knows and extended as well. My mom has been a Peach all my life about looking at me while she's speaking, being clear, calmly repeating herself, and flicking the lights or hitting the wall when she wants my attention. \\nMy dad on the other hand, has never been this way. I grew up with him constantly mumbling and never doing any of the things listed above. He would (and still does) tell me that I need to turn down whatever I'm listening to (whether it's the TV or my phone) because he can \\\"hear it over his TV\\\" (and phone, he watches TV and videos at the same time, baffling to me), and I \\\"don't need it that loud to hear it, I'm right next to it\\\". \\nI spent many a nights as a child staying up until I was too tired to stay up anymore because I couldn't sleep without the radio on, and my dad would scold me and even take it away if it was too loud. \\nHe even went as far as to establish a volume limit on the TV. 14 is the highest I'm able to use it when he's home. \\nAnd then, when I'm in the kitchen/ in his general vicinity, he gets mad when I have my music playing in my hearing aids, (when he CAN'T HEAR IT), because he always has something snarky to say about whatever I'm doing. \\nAnd when I explicitly tell him I'm going to be listening to something and I won't be able to hear him, he mouths words and laughs to get my attention because it makes me angry. \\nNobody in my family even remotely knows any ASL, so learning it on my own has been tiresome and useless. I wasn't enveloped in any sort of deaf culture, and didn't even know ASL was even an option for a long time, because they put me straight into speech therapy. \\nMany of my family members still don't follow the basic \\\"terms and conditions\\\" if you will, of talking to me: be clear, repeat yourself when I ask, don't dismiss me when I do so, etc.\\nNot to mention, this happens so much at work as well. I got endless flack one time for mindlessly agreeing with a coworker friend of mine. While I should've asked for clarification, and I made it clear after the fact that I didn't hear her, they still teased me all night about it.\\nI work in a place where it's loud a lot, and everyone knows (or should know by now, I've been working there for 2 years) that I'm HoH, and how to interact with me. That doesn't stop them from still turning away while talking to me, trying to talk to me while blenders are on, etc. \\nI guess my big question is, is it really that difficult for someone to come up to you, say \\\"I'm HoH, here's how to talk to me\\\", and have them just...\\nRemember? \\nIt's exhausting having to constantly advocate for myself to everyone!!! \\nIt just hits me sometimes in random moments- moments that seem unimportant to others but have a big impact on my self esteem/confidence. Like not catching a part of the conversation, but now everybody's laughing and I'm left behind. \\n\\nSorry for the super long post \\ud83d\\ude43 but I've been feeling this way for a super long time and I'm desperate to see if anybody else who can remotely relate to me can understand. I could vent to my friends but they're all hearing, so they just wouldn't even begin to be able to understand on a base level.\\n\\nEdit: I'm also feeling stuck between both worlds: I don't feel hearing enough to participate in the hearing world, and my asl literacy isn't good enough to fully participate in the D/deaf world :(( I identify more as deaf anyway, and I watch asl videos and news to try and up my comprehension but I'm never able to consistently practice because nobody around me knows enough /is Deaf \\nI'd much rather be completely Deaf or Hearing than this purgatory I find myself in\",\n",

    "            \"Charlie Kirk's Name Sign is \\\"Cock Penis.\\\" Sign. His. Name.\\n#Let\\u2019s Set the Stage First\\n\\nWildfires ravaged the Los Angeles area between January 7 and January 31 of this year.\\n\\nOn January 8, during that day\\u2019s episode of The Charlie Kirk Show, Charlie Kirk made a comment suggesting that ASL interpreters on TV broadcasts are distracting and should be eliminated.\\n\\nThe deaf community responded swiftly and with near-unity. Many scoffed at Kirk and called him an idiot for not understanding that ASL is a primary language for many deaf people\\u2014and that access to it is essential.\\n\\n#The Spark\\u2026 \\n\\nLast week, Charlie Kirk made a stop at Oklahoma State University (OSU) as part of his American Comeback Tour.\\n\\nHe held his usual media event, where he interacted directly with the audience. Logan Evans, a local deaf person, seized the opportunity to confront Kirk about his wildfire-era comments suggesting ASL interpreters should be removed because closed captions already exist.\\n\\nKirk responded in a surprisingly conciliatory way. He said that after seeing the deaf community\\u2019s reaction, he reached out to a deaf person who explained that ASL is many deaf individuals\\u2019 primary language. Therefore, ASL interpreters on emergency broadcasts are critical for delivering life-saving information.\\n\\nKirk claimed he had learned from the experience\\u2014and that he now empathizes with the need for interpreter access during emergencies.\\n\\nThis was unexpected, especially given Kirk\\u2019s typically combative personality. Most people assumed he\\u2019d double down.\\n\\nLogan and Kirk exchanged a few more comments. Then, at the end, Logan told Kirk he\\u2019d like to give him a sign name.\\n\\nThe sign name Logan gave him was an initialized combination of the letters \\u201cC\\u201d and \\u201cK\\u201d on the nose.\\n\\nBefore moving on further, I want to acknowledge the diversity of this subreddit. Not all of us are immersed in the ASL-based Deaf world\\u2014so I\\u2019ll break it down clearly.\\n\\nIn ASL, the sign name Logan gave Charlie Kirk breaks down as:\\n\\n**Cock** \\u2013 The letter \\u201cC\\u201d tapped on or near the nose can be interpreted as \\u201ccock.\\u201d It\\u2019s not a standard or widely accepted sign for \\u201ccock,\\u201d but in this context, that\\u2019s the intended meaning.\\n\\n**Penis** \\u2013  The handshape for \\u201cK\\u201d is very similar to \\u201cP.\\u201d In ASL, the official sign for \\u201cpenis\\u201d is the letter \\u201cP\\u201d on the nose. So signing \\u201cK\\u201d on the nose closely resembles that\\u2014effectively making it a visual pun.\\n\\nSo the sign name Logan gave Kirk? It translates in ASL to: \\u201cCock Penis.\\u201d\\n\\n#\\u2026That Ignited the Deaf Community!\\n\\nCharlie Kirk posted the clip of his exchange with Logan Evans on YouTube, and it quickly went viral within the deaf community.\\n\\nAt first, the reaction\\u2014particularly among left-leaning deaf folks\\u2014was overwhelmingly positive. Many found the sign name hilarious. In online discussions, people joked that Logan had become a legend for giving Kirk such a title.\\n\\nThen things got complicated.\\n\\nLogan posted [a vlog on his Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1YXQMFYDTg/) apologizing to the community for his actions.\\n\\n(Author\\u2019s note: I know this sub expects a summary when linking to ASL vlogs without captions. In this case, Logan provided a transcript in the post. It\\u2019s a near-exact English translation of what he signed\\u2014so that\\u2019s the accessibility option for anyone who needs it.)\\n\\nIt turns out Logan is an ASL professor at Oklahoma State University\\u2014the same campus where he confronted Charlie Kirk. The community also learned he\\u2019s the president of the Oklahoma Association of the Deaf, a state chapter affiliated with NAD.\\n\\n#A Breakdown of Logan\\u2019s Apology\\n\\nThere are quite a few layers to Logan\\u2019s apology.\\n\\nCommon sense suggests that he likely issued the public apology because his job as a professor at Oklahoma State University may be in jeopardy. That much is understandable. It\\u2019s also likely he apologized because he upset members of the Oklahoma Association of the Deaf\\u2014a lot of them lean politically to the right.\\n\\nHowever, it wasn\\u2019t the \\u201cCock Penis\\u201d sign name itself that truly sparked the current discourse in the deaf community. It was the apology.\\n\\nLogan didn\\u2019t just apologize for appearing in a recorded video at a Charlie Kirk event and giving him that sign name. He apologized for upsetting and \\u201charming\\u201d the deaf community as a whole.\\n\\nAnd that\\u2019s what really ignited the conversation.\\n\\nSeveral members of the deaf community felt he shouldn\\u2019t have apologized to the right-leaning segment of the community\\u2014especially those who support Charlie Kirk and his well-documented history of hateful rhetoric. That part of the community, many argued, has long tolerated or even endorsed Kirk\\u2019s racism, sexism, anti-LGBTQ (especially anti-trans), and xenophobic views.\\n\\nPersonally, I agree with that stance.\\n\\nI was fine with the idea of Logan apologizing for participating in a media event and giving Charlie Kirk the \\u201cCock Penis\\u201d sign name. That was, no question, a lapse in professional judgment. He should have foreseen that doing so would cross a line\\u2014especially considering his role as president of the Oklahoma Association of the Deaf. (And let\\u2019s be real: we all know how red Oklahoma is.)\\n\\nBut I definitely side-eyed how *far* Logan took his apology. He apologized to the entire deaf community.\\n\\n#The Deaf Community\\u2019s Responses to Logan\\u2019s Apology\\n\\nOver the weekend, several prominent deaf vloggers posted their thoughts on the incident. In this section, I\\u2019ll break down their responses in the order they appeared.\\n\\n(Author's note: I want to respect this subreddit\\u2019s rule about linking ASL vlogs without captions. When I reference these vlogs, I\\u2019ll provide written summaries\\u2014or paraphrase them in simple terms to keep it accessible and easy to follow.)\\n\\n**The Beginning \\u2013 The First Response:**\\n\\nTim Gough reposted Logan Evans\\u2019 apology along with a text-based response on Facebook.\\n\\n*Context:* Tim is a deaf professor at an Interpreter Training Program (ITP) at a college in California. He occasionally posts public vlogs addressing issues in the deaf community.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s what Tim Gough wrote:\\n\\n&gt;I would not accept his apology.\\n\\n&gt;That name sign was not fair, especially after Charlie Kirk listened and apologized for his ignorance.\\n\\n&gt;Trump and Elon Musk listen to people like Charlie Kirk. Can you imagine him telling them he was getting screwed with an inappropriate name sign?\\n\\n&gt;He has an accountability to the highest level as somebody who works in the profession.\\u201d\\n\\n**The Rising Response \\u2013 The Second Response:**\\n\\nTamera Gaudet-Doody responded to Tim Gough\\u2019s post with [a vlog of her own](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1ANSbhWrwC/).\\n\\n*Context:* Tamera currently runs a YouTube channel where she frequently vlogs about the Trump administration. She rose to prominence in the deaf community when she launched a platform called \\u201cROAR\\u201d (Re-framing Our ASL Rights)\\u2014created in protest of LEAD-K\\u2019s partnership with the AG Bell Association in collecting language deprivation data. Tamera was strongly opposed to any affiliation between pro-ASL organizations and AG Bell. (This incident, which happened just before the pandemic, deserves its own post\\u2014maybe another time.)\\n\\n*Vlog Summary:*\\n\\nTamera\\u2019s vlog echoed a common frustration among left-leaning individuals: that Democrats often hold themselves to higher standards than they demand from Republicans. She argued that this double standard must end.\\n\\nShe expressed sympathy for Logan\\u2019s situation and saw nothing wrong with the sign name he gave Kirk. In fact, she found it hilarious.\\n\\nTamera highlighted the consistently destructive language used by the political right against liberal and marginalized communities, and she welcomed Logan Evans to the broader fight against the Trump administration.\\n\\n**The Climax \\u2013 The Third Response:**\\n\\nTim Gough replied to Tamera with[ a vlog of his own.](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1989QVWwyW/)\\n\\n*Vlog Summary:*\\n\\nTim opened by referencing Michelle Obama\\u2019s famous quote: \\u201cWhen they go low, we go high.\\u201d\\n\\nHe then revealed that he follows Charlie Kirk on social media and enjoys Kirk\\u2019s challenges to left-leaning views.\\n\\nThe heart of Tim\\u2019s vlog was his surprise that Charlie Kirk\\u2014someone aligned with Trump and Elon Musk\\u2014had shown even a moment of reflection and expressed understanding about the importance of ASL interpreters in emergency broadcasts. Tim described Kirk\\u2019s reaction as \\u201cbeautiful\\u201d and suggested it could be a step toward building a bridge between the Trump/Musk world and the deaf community.\\n\\nTim went on to call Logan an arrogant and attention-seeking deaf person who exploited the moment to assign an inappropriate name sign to Charlie Kirk.\\n\\nHe criticized Logan\\u2019s actions in the context of his professional roles\\u2014as a university professor and as president of a deaf organization. Tim argued that when a deaf person gives a hearing person a sign name, that act carries weight and is often perceived as representing the broader deaf community.\\n\\nAccording to Tim, the \\u201cCock Penis\\u201d name sign was politically motivated and didn\\u2019t reflect the values of half the deaf community. He concluded by laying out his reasons for refusing to forgive Logan Evans.\\n\\n#Elvis Zornoza\\n\\nElvis Zornoza posted [a vlog in support of Tim Gough\\u2019s previous vlog.](https://www.facebook.com/reel/680353067739297)\\n\\n*Context:* Elvis is an emerging deaf social media personality. While I believe he\\u2019s originally from Kentucky, he spent most of his life in California. He built his reputation by vlogging about drama and issues within the California School for the Deaf in Fremont (near San Francisco) and the broader Bay Area deaf community. Over time, he became something of a controversial figure\\u2014eventually leaving for Southern California in a kind of self-imposed exile before enrolling at Gallaudet University earlier this year.\\n\\nHe now posts regularly on TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram, often about his experiences at Gallaudet. I also believe he briefly attended the university in the 1980s or 1990s, but left after his partner became pregnant. He raised his children and, now that they\\u2019re grown, has returned to pursue a degree.\\n\\n*Vlog Summary:*\\n\\n(Author\\u2019s note: This is the vlog that boils my blood the most.)\\n\\nTo be blunt, Elvis Zornoza is painfully ignorant, oblivious, and near-sighted\\u2014not only about Charlie Kirk as a person, but also about the full context of what Turning Point USA represents. He shows no understanding of the organization\\u2019s deep involvement in the Trump-era political landscape, nor of how it has functioned as a pipeline connecting American youth with far-right extremism.\\n\\nAfter a short intro explaining what his Facebook reel would cover, Elvis brushed off the politics entirely. He said it didn\\u2019t matter whether Charlie Kirk was left-leaning or right-leaning\\u2014because, in Elvis\\u2019s view, that wasn\\u2019t the point.\\n\\nThe point, according to Elvis, was that Charlie Kirk is the founder of Turning Point USA\\u2014which Elvis emphasized is a \\u201cnational student movement!\\u201d He punctuated the moment with an enthusiastic:\\n\\n\\u201cWhoa!\\u201d\\n\\nFrom there, Elvis echoed Tim Gough\\u2019s stance, calling Logan \\u201carrogant\\u201d for ruining what he saw as a golden opportunity: bringing Turning Point USA\\u2019s platform to the deaf community, and introducing Kirk to deaf needs\\u2014only to squander it with the \\u201cCock Penis\\u201d sign name.\\n\\nAnd then Elvis took it to a whole new level of absurdity.\\n\\nHe said Logan\\u2019s apology wasn\\u2019t enough. In his view, Logan should now go even further\\u2014he should get deeply involved with Turning Point USA. Elvis suggested that Logan become the deaf ambassador for Charlie Kirk and Turning Point USA, and that he use that role to bring the deaf community closer to the Trump administration.\\n\\nLet me make one thing very clear. Elvis has no known history of engaging with or supporting right-wing politics. His social media content has been focused almost exclusively on issues affecting the pro-ASL deaf community. From what I\\u2019ve seen, he seems to lean left.\\n\\nHe\\u2019s just\\u2026 completely and dangerously uninformed on this topic.\\n\\n#Wildfire Now\\n\\nAt this point, the situation has fully ignited across the deaf community\\u2014it\\u2019s everywhere. The discourse isn\\u2019t dying down anytime soon. Many are now quietly anticipating some kind of public response from the Oklahoma community, especially regarding Logan Evans and the two positions of power he currently holds:\\n\\n-His job as a teacher\\n\\n-His seat as President of the Oklahoma Association of the Deaf (OAD)\\n\\n#Here are some other vlogs that have recently emerged:\\n\\nTim Gough made [a follow-up vlog.](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/16G71hXYUV/)\\n\\n(Author\\u2019s note: I honestly don\\u2019t think this is worth summarizing. I\\u2019m just putting it here for those who want to watch it.)\\n\\n[Joy Maisel](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/19uYDH46FF/) and [Tar Burt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nwUSZlGwvk) each made vlogs expressing full-throated support for Charlie Kirk\\u2019s new sign name\\u2014declaring they will happily embrace \\u201cCock Penis\\u201d as his official ASL identity.\\n\\n#Ricky Taylor\\n\\nRicky Taylor, a man who truly needs no introduction, posted three vlogs about the fiasco. You can watch them [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJV0t_TBF6s), [here](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/15AFrESQts/), and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWR6nS1JfNU). Below is a synthesized summary of all three.\\n\\nRicky didn\\u2019t hold back.\\n\\nHe directly confronted Tim Gough (author\\u2019s note: they know each other personally) and delivered a searing takedown. Ricky tore Tim apart for completely missing the point of what was being said\\u2014that Charlie Kirk\\u2019s \\u201cmoment of openness\\u201d toward the deaf community wasn\\u2019t genuine, and to treat it as a turning point was naive at best.\\n\\nIn one of the most memorable moments, Ricky spurred a phrase that stuck with me:\\n\\nTim\\u2014and by extension, a big chunk of the deaf community\\u2014are goldfish living in a fishbowl.\\n\\nI\\u2019ll expand on this analogy below, but it was devastatingly accurate.\\n\\nHe then launched into a blistering critique of Charlie Kirk\\u2019s long and well-documented history of inflammatory rhetoric toward marginalized communities\\u2014including immigrants, BIPOC folks, disabled people, and the LGBTQ+ community. To suggest Charlie Kirk is now an ally just because he was humble in his response to Logan? Please.\\n\\n#Wesley Arey\\n\\nThe deaf community\\u2019s beloved trash god, Wesley Arey, [made a vlog.](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/18rie1b1FA/)\\n\\nThe summary is simple:\\n\\nHe fooled around with his motorcycle at home, repeatedly said \\u201cCock Penis\\u201d in a variety of obscenely creative ways, and that was the vlog.\\n\\nI would never admit this in public, but this is Reddit, so screw it \\u2014\\nIt\\u2019s been a while since I laughed that hard.\\n\\n#The \\u201cGoldfishes in a Fishbowl\\u201d Analogy\\n\\nI love this analogy.\\n\\nImagine a beach house on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean. On a windowsill inside, there\\u2019s a little fishbowl with a couple of goldfish swimming in circles.\\n\\nNow ask yourself: do those goldfish live in water? Yes. But can they truly grasp what the ocean is? No. Despite living their entire lives in an aquatic environment, their world is defined by the tight, controlled space of that fishbowl\\u2014maybe even ending in a flush down the toilet.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s exactly how it feels watching certain members of the pro-ASL deaf world try to speak on complex political or societal issues. Their worldview is shaped by an insular culture, often cut off from broader conversations happening in the rest of society. So when they step onto a national or even regional public stage to speak on topics like free speech, hate groups, or political dynamics\\u2014they don\\u2019t realize how limited their framework is. They just don\\u2019t know what they don\\u2019t know.\\n\\nTim Gough is a prime example of this. But Elvis Zornoza, in this case, might be an even clearer one.\\n\\nThis analogy also resonates deeply with me. I grew up in a mainstream environment. I have one foot in the deaf world, and the other firmly planted in the larger world. So when I see people speaking confidently from inside the fishbowl, I can\\u2019t help but feel frustrated\\u2014and sometimes even embarrassed.\\n\\n#Conclusion\\n\\nI think this entire post speaks for itself. So I want to close with a piece of advice for all deaf college students.\\n\\nCharlie Kirk will visit your campus. You will be tempted to show up to his event. And you might feel like you can go up to the mic and speak your truth.\\n\\nPlease understand this: that\\u2019s exactly what he wants.\\n\\nCharlie Kirk\\u2019s entire schtick is built around baiting left-leaning students into confronting him on stage. He films it, spins it, and posts it on social media to generate rage-clicks and ridicule from his audience. That\\u2019s the game.\\n\\nIf you find yourself at his mic\\u2014you\\u2019ve already lost. Not because your values are wrong (they\\u2019re not), but because Charlie Kirk is absurdly well-prepared. He has a scripted answer ready for every progressive talking point. He will tear you apart, not because he\\u2019s right, but because it\\u2019s his arena. And once the clip hits his socials, you become content\\u2014fodder for right-wing dopamine.\\n\\nLogan Evans fell into this trap. Yes, we\\u2019re sympathetic to him. Yes, we cheer the absurd poetry of him giving Charlie Kirk the \\u201cCock Penis\\u201d name sign.\\n\\nBut let this be a lesson.\\n\\nDon\\u2019t let Charlie Kirk use you. Don\\u2019t let him spin your voice into viral content for people who don\\u2019t care about our community or our dignity.\\n\\nBe smarter than the fishbowl.\\n\\nAnd with that\\u2026\\n\\n**Happy National ASL Day!**\",\n",

But as I can essentially pass as a hearing person, I can have conversations fine, watch movies and TV shows (usually with the subtitles), and rarely actually struggle with my hearing, I just don't feel like I have any claim to the community or to call myself hard of hearing. Similarly, I feel like that if I were to learn ASL, I'd be 'faking' that I have a hearing issue if I tell people my reasons for wanting to learn.\\n\\nI don't know.

Curse words are spoken and the CC words are changed. For example, someone says the word \\u201cshit\\u201d, and the CC word is changed to sh*t. Or spoken word \\u201cfuck\\u201d is changed to fugg.

I was watching a murder mystery video and the content creator said \\\"the killer cocked the gun\\\" and subtitles didn't show the word \\\"cocked.\\\" Before the CI who knows how much content I've watched that was altered in the subtitles for 20-ish years?

If the person repeats/stutters, sometimes those repeats are removed. If the message can be expressed in a simpler way, sometimes they rewrite it to make it shorter. A video game I'm playing has a habit of leaving out large chunks of filler dialogue, even when I'm paying attention to the talking NPC (in all fairness it could be a bug, but still). I often end up completely missing what was said purely because I'm confused why I'm hearing things that aren't appearing on my screen.\\n\\nI know this wasn't exactly what you're venting about but I feel you. There needs to be significant changes to captions. Honestly, I would take free time out of my day to watch things and re-caption them because it pisses me off so much.

    "            \"Hospital staff accidentally lost my hearing aids and then blamed me.\\nI\\u2019m so pissed off and frustrated that I just need to vent where someone can surely understand my point of view and perspective. :( \\n\\nI\\u2019m classed as clinically extremely vulnerable to COVID19 as I\\u2019ve had an organ transplant and I\\u2019m currently in hospital which is sending my anxiety levels through the roof as it is, being near this hospital. \\n\\nIt\\u2019s been such a shit experience as a deaf person with all the PPE. I\\u2019m classed as borderline profoundly deaf but I can converse and also sign. I can\\u2019t lipread them with the mask and they can\\u2019t take the masks off. I\\u2019m a bilateral hearing aid user and whilst I\\u2019m still very much deaf even with them in, they\\u2019re currently my actual lifeline/ears at the moment as I don\\u2019t have that lipreading option I do heavily rely on in everyday life! \\n\\nI obviously don\\u2019t sleep with the hearing aids in and just put to the side so I can grab straight away when I wake up. I\\u2019ve had nurses attending all night and somehow, they\\u2019ve accidentally picked up, thrown out or lost my hearing aids which were in their phonak case on the side. Accidentally losing hearing aids happens and I totally get it and I\\u2019m sure it was not intentional but the way the staff have dealt with it is totally shocking. \\n\\nIt went something like this:\\n\\nMe: Uh I think someone has picked them up by accident...\\n\\nNurse: Ok let\\u2019s look (cue them throughly checking everything even checking mattress etc)\\n\\nNurse: Nope they\\u2019re not here sorry...\\n\\nMe: Uh ok (slight panic) what\\u2019s the next steps then? I need to get replacements ASAP as they\\u2019re my lifeline and I\\u2019m struggling...\\n\\nNurse: What do you mean? It\\u2019s not our responsibility. Anything at your bedside is YOUR responsibility, you should have put anything valuable in the safe deposit box for safekeeping but you didn\\u2019t, so... *shrugs and walks off*\\n\\nI\\u2019m currently bed bound and not got out of bed in 4 days so unless I dropped them down side of the bed onto floor... that\\u2019s the only instance in which I could have had any responsibility for losing them. I can\\u2019t reach anything but the side table so I had no option but to put them there. \\n\\nNurse again: it\\u2019s a lesson learnt love! (Totally sarcastic) you shouldn\\u2019t put something so expensive and important down so willy nilly like that. \\n\\nI mean, WTAF?! Who the hell would put their hearing aids in the safe deposit box when you got nurses/coming to bedside all through the day/night. You don\\u2019t put your expensive designer glasses in a safe deposit box every time you go to sleep do you?! They were in my phonak case not just on the side \\u2018willy nilly\\u2019... \\n\\nThey\\u2019re expensive to replace as I had to pay private to have more discreet looking ones as NHS wouldn\\u2019t fund them. I\\u2019m absolutely fuming. Not that they\\u2019re lost as such but just the blatant disregard and attitude the staff are showing me and not taking responsibility. There\\u2019s a sign next to the bed about valuables being my responsibility at the bedside and she just keeps pointing at the sign (she\\u2019s muffling something through her mask as well but obviously I don\\u2019t know what)\\n\\nHearing aids are not the same kind of valuables as a phone, wallet or keys! They\\u2019re my ears and my lifeline right now! What if they lost someone\\u2019s prosthetic limb and they couldn\\u2019t walk? Or a blind persons stick so they can navigate independently. Talk about disability discrimination! It\\u2019s totally not on! \\n\\nI\\u2019m already having a scary shit time and I struggle at the best of times hearing doctors/nurses but now I\\u2019m just feel so isolated and silent from everything and I\\u2019m not feeling supported at all when it comes to effective communication when discussing my health. In normal circumstances, I\\u2019d use a family member to be there to be my ears but no one is allowed to visit due to pandemic. I cried at them to make them understand how much I\\u2019m struggling and begged them to ring Audiology (who are in same hospital) to give me any kind of replacement. I\\u2019ve followed some peoples advice on recording/transcript apps but my internet/signal on my phone is non-existent and it\\u2019s not effective right now. The hospital are just dismissing any requests or responsibility and have not even apologised or offered to replace them. \\n\\nSorry for the rant but I just hate this! :(\\n\\nEdit: a whole load of spelling errors due to my angry tear-filled rant.\\n\\nUPDATE: PALS are in contact and have basically said they\\u2019re definitely in the wrong and they\\u2019re making a case. All names are documented of people on shift and nurses/doctors involved in my care. They\\u2019ve got in touch with Audiology too and they\\u2019re furious and being fantastic about it - They\\u2019re gonna get my replacements to me within the next few hours or so. The audiologist guy asked to speak to ward manager on video call with me and he basically shouted (and signed for me) that treating me like this was discrimination and disgusting and he was taking it further himself. He apologised to me profusely and understands the struggle that deaf people are having right now with PPE and effective communication in the hospital with deaf patients. Which was lovely and finally feel like I\\u2019m getting somewhere! It\\u2019s been such an emotional couple of days being ill and dealing with this drama and the procedures I\\u2019m having done. Thanks deaf community for just letting me vent and your supportive lovely comments. &lt;3\\n\\n\\nEDIT 2: Not only did Audiology replace my hearing aids, they replaced them with the same discreet models as before and they charged the ward for it and they finally agreed and backed down once PALS were involved! I got my ears back! Thank you so much all!\"\n",

    "            \"Hearing Loss Know How\\nI see so many lost in hearing loss and I was there myself in 2008 for a few years. Hearing loss isn't the end of the world though I know it feels like it at times. (My entire life changed after the last big drop.) After attending many events provided by the state of Utah, I learned that hearing loss is a different way of communicating and I now know the work arounds. If people don't do their part, I can't do my part. (Get my attention first and face me.) I learned how to self advocate which made a huge difference and I know all my options for accommodations. None of this information seems to be shared freely from doctors and so on. It's still a huge mystery and the best kept secret. \\n\\nWe are trying to change that. We offer the only how-to video podcast out there for hearing loss specific situations and they are free. Julia, Michele and Chelle share their perspectives providing options for any given situation.  Julia is a hearing CART/live captioning provider who has family members with hearing loss. Michele is deaf, relies on lipreading (she's our master lipreader) and captioning for communication. Chelle has a severe hearing loss using hearing aids and other technology along with lipreading.\\n\\nIn 2022 we will have more guests from the HoH community to share inspiration. Our podcasts are available on video with captions, in a transcript on BuzzSprout and audibly on different platforms.  We have 18 podcasts completed and viewable on our website or on YouTube. We will continue to bring one a week in 2022.

And like feeling all attacked because X y z.\\nSo I thought, well 1, I'm passionate about this and like to talk about the stuff I'm passionate about, and 2, maybe they'll listen to a hearing person... idk if that's the right mindset to have but these guys really don't listen :/\\n\\nAnother thing I wanted to clarify, is in the videos I'll say stuff like \\\"I'm hearing, and can't speak for the Deaf community, so take what I say with a grain of salt, and listen to Deaf people/follow Deaf creators.\\\"\\nCause I don't want people ONLY listening to me. I feel like that's kinda doing exactly what I want people to stop doing.\\n\\nBut idk if it's just a bad idea overall?

I already knew how to fingerspell and do a few basic signs just from past interest, so he told me to make a sign name for myself. \\n\\nHe said use one or two initials and sign them just somewhere. I remembered an asl song translation I saw on youtube once that used a couple sign names - one included the sign for old, modified with the person\\u2019s initial, and the other was the sign for music, also modified to include the initial. I love music, always have a song stuck in my head, and one of the first things people learn about me is the fact that I love to sing - unless I\\u2019m sick, not a day goes by that I don\\u2019t sing. Also my nickname in the hearing community is Tunes. So I thought that would be fitting. \\n\\nMy teacher told me that sign names don\\u2019t use actual signs and what I saw was purely poetic and not used in real life with real people. He said it\\u2019s just signing one or two initials either on the air in front of you or maybe at your shoulder or by your head. \\n\\nDifferent locations don\\u2019t mean anything to me though, so I felt overwhelmed. I decided to google sign names. The sources I got said that yes sign names do often include modified signs, with increasing frequency, but a sign name is not something you can choose for yourself - it\\u2019s a badge of honor given to you by someone in the deaf community. \\n\\nSo now I\\u2019m just super confused. Can anyone help clarify?\"\n",
